This repository includes the content for COGA Design Patterns for People with Cognitive and Learning Disabilities.

NB! some of the content is generated from content in the w3c/coga repo using the script `scripts/buildcoga`.
Build is manually triggered (run the script and commit) so the latest coga content is only included when wanted.
This built content is also checked in to git so it can be used by the wai-website
Coga source content is accessed as a git submodule in `_external/resources/coga`.

The generated files are:

- `/content/_cogabuild`
- `/content-images/wai-coa-design-guide`

Supplemental guidance provides advice for content authors and designers on improving the accessibility of content and applications beyond what is required by [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) (WCAG).

While the guidance presented here focuses on particular groups, it is important to note that people may require different combinations of accessibility features unique to them and their current situation. For example, someone with a cognitive disability may also have auditory, physical, neurological, speech and visual disabilities. Thus, this guidance must always be applied in conjunction with WCAG in order to maximize accessibility for everyone.

## Cognitive Accessibility Design Patterns

The Design Patterns focus on reducing barriers experienced by people with cognitive and learning disabilities. The Patterns describe what to do in order to improve accessibility and explain how this helps when applied. Examples are also provided.

Related Design Patterns are grouped into Objectives. The Objectives provide a high level overview of the areas where people experience cognitive accessibility barriers.

The Design Patterns and Objectives are drawn from the more comprehensive document “[Making Content Usable for People with Cognitive and Learning Disabilities](https://www.w3.org/TR/coga-usable/)”. This provides additional background, user stories, personas, a glossary, and other guidance.

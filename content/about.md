This guide provides assistance making websites and applications usable by people with cognitive and learning disabilities by providing guidance for designs and the design process.

The Objectives and Patterns presented here provide supplemental guidance beyond the requirements of WCAG. They are intended to address barriers that could not not be included in the normative WCAG 2.x specification and may not otherwise be addressed.

This guide is divided into design themes. Each theme includes user stories, testing methodologies, and design checkpoints. Simply understanding the themes and user stories may help designers make content more accessible to some users with cognitive and learning disabilities. Implementing these patterns is essential for some people with cognitive and learning impairments to be able to use content independently. Please see the section on user testing for guidance on how to perform cognitive accessibility user testing.

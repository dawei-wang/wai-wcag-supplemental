Eventually we expect to include other sections as well as Coga. For example, Low Vision.

Supplemental guidance provides advice for web content authors and evaluators on ensuring content and applications are accessible.
It is additional information beyond what is required by WCAG or is covered in WCAG's supporting documents, techniques, and the ACT testing guidance.

While the guidance is presented here as being for particular groups, it is important to note that everyone requires a combination of accessibility features unique to them and their current situation. Thus, this guidance must always be applied in conjunction with WCAG in order to achieve maximum accessibility.

## Design Patterns for People with Cognitive and Learning Disabilities

The Design Patterns presented in this guide provide practical steps for reducing barriers experienced by People with Cognitive and Learning Disabilities. The Patterns describe what to do in order to improve accessibility and explain how this helps when thoughtfully applied. Examples are also provided.

The many Patterns are grouped into Objectives to help organise them into common themes. The Objectives also provide a convenient high level overview of the areas where people experience cognitive accessibility barriers. An easy read outline of these objectives can also be found in the @@At a Glance page on the WAI website. Each Objective has a short summary.

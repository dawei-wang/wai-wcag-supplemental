Eventually we expect to include other sections as well as Coga. For example, Low Vision.

Supplemental guidance provides advice for web content authors and evaluators on ensuring content and applications are accessible.
It is additional information beyond what is required by WCAG and what is also explained in WCAG's supporting documents, techniques, and ACT testing guidance.

While the guidance is presented here for particular groups, it should be remembered that people aways require a combination of accessilbilty features that is unique to them and their current situation. Thus this guidence should be applied in conjuction with the Success Criteria presented in WCAG.

## Design Patterns for People with Cognitive and Learning Disabilities

The Design Patterns presented in this guide provide practical steps for reducing barriers experienced by People with with Cognitive and Learning Disabilities. The Patterns describe what to do to improve accessibility and explain how they help when thoughtfuly applied. Examples are also provided to clarify the desribed actions.

The many Patterns are grouped into Objectives to organise them into common themes. The Objectives also provide a high level overview of the areas where people experience cognitive accessibility problems. An easy read outline of these objectives can also be found in the @@At a Glance page on the WAI website. Each Objective has a short summary.

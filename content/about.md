Supplemental guidance provides advice for content authors and designers on improving the accessibility of content and applications beyond what is required by [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) (WCAG).

While the guidance presented here focuses on particular groups, it is important to note that people may require different combinations of accessibility features unique to them and their current situation. For example, someone with a cognitive disability may also have auditory, physical, neurological, speech and visual disabilities. Thus, this guidance must always be applied in conjunction with WCAG in order to maximize accessibility for everyone.

## About Cognitive Accessibility Guidance

This guidance provides a set of "Objectives" for reducing barriers experienced by people with cognitive and learning disabilities. The Objectives provide an overview and include a set of Design Patterns. Each Pattern explains what to do in order to improve accessibility, how this helps when applied, and includes examples.

The Objectives and Design Patterns are drawn from the more comprehensive document “[Making Content Usable for People with Cognitive and Learning Disabilities](https://www.w3.org/TR/coga-usable/)”. This provides additional background, user stories, personas, a glossary, and other guidance.

<p>
  Memory barriers stop many users from using products or accessing help or
  content.
</p>
<p>
  People with any impairment that affects memory or language can find it
  difficult or impossible to overcome memory barriers.
</p>
<p>
  For example, many users have an impaired short-term memory. On average people
  can remember 7 letters or items at the same time. A person with an impaired
  working memory may be able to remember one to four pieces of information at
  the same time (depending on the extent of the impairment). If they need to
  remember other tasks, such as track what they have done, they are likely to
  make mistakes.
</p>

<p>Avoid barriers such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    navigating voice menus that involve remembering a specific number or term,
  </li>
  <li>remembering numbers while processing words on a voice menu,</li>
  <li>transcribing text, or</li>
  <li>remembering passwords.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Allow users access to content, services or help, without using processes that
  rely on memory. Make sure there is an easier option for people who need it.
</p>

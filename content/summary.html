<p>
  This summary is written in an easy to understand language. To help web content
  providers meet the needs of people with cognitive and learning disabilities we
  have identified the following key topics:
</p>
<div class="imagelist">
  <section id="summary-understand">
    <h2>Help users understand what things are and how to use them.</h2>
    <p>
      Use icons, symbols, terms, and design patterns that are already familiar
      to users so that they do not have to learn new ones. People with
      <a>cognitive and learning disabilities</a> often need common behavior and
      design patterns. For example, use the standard convention for hyperlinks
      (underlined and blue for unvisited; purple for visited).
    </p>

    <p>See the Patterns in <a href="">Objective 1</a>.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="summary-find">
    <h2>Help users find what they need.</h2>
    <p>
      Make navigating the system easy. Use a clear and easy-to-follow layout
      with visual cues, such as icons. Clear headings, boundaries, and regions
      also helps people understand the page design.
    </p>
    <p>See the Patterns in <a href="">Objective 2</a>.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="summary-clear-content">
    <h2>Use clear content (text, images and media).</h2>
    <p>
      This includes easy words, short sentences and blocks of text, clear
      images, and easy to understand video.
    </p>
    <p>See the Patterns in <a href="">Objective 3</a>.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="summary-mistakes">
    <h2>Help users avoid mistakes.</h2>
    <p>
      A good design makes errors less likely. Ask the user only for what you
      need! When errors occur, make it easy for the user to correct them.
    </p>
    <p>See the Patterns in <a href="">Objective 4</a>.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="summary-focus">
    <h2>Help users focus.</h2>
    <p>
      Avoid distracting the user from their tasks. If the user does get
      distracted, headings and breadcrumbs can help orientate the user and help
      the user restore the context when it is lost. Providing linked breadcrumbs
      can help the user undo mistakes.
    </p>

    <p>See the Patterns in <a href="">Objective 5</a>.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="summary-memory">
    <h2>Ensure processes do not rely on memory.</h2>
    <p>
      Memory barriers stop people with cognitive disabilities from using
      content. This includes long passwords to log in and voice menus that
      involve remembering a specific number or term. Make sure there is an
      easier option for people who need it.
    </p>

    <p>See the Patterns in <a href="">Objective 6</a>.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="summary-support">
    <h2>Provide help and support.</h2>
    <p>
      This includes: <strong>making it easy to get human help.</strong> If users
      have difficulty sending feedback, then you will never know if they are
      able to use the content or when they are experiencing problems. In
      addition,
      <strong>support different ways to understand content.</strong> Graphics,
      summaries of long documents, adding icons to headings and links, and
      alternatives for numbers are all examples of extra help and support.
    </p>

  </section>

  <section id="summary-personalization">
    <h2>Support adaptation and personalization.</h2>
    <p>
      People with <a>cognitive and learning disabilities</a> often use add-ons
      or extensions as assistive technology. Sometimes, extra support requires
      minimal effort from the user via personalization that allows the user to
      select preferred options from a set of alternatives. Support
      personalization when you can. Do not disable add-ons and extensions!
      Sometimes users can receive extra support through personalization.
    </p>

  </section>

  <section id="summary-test">
    <h2>Test with real users!</h2>
    <p>
      Involve people with cognitive and learning disabilities in the research,
      design, and development process. Theyâ€™re the experts in what works for
      them. This includes involving people with
      <a>cognitive and learning disabilities</a> in:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>focus groups.</li>
      <li>usability tests, and</li>
      <li>the design and research team.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
</div>

title: Help Users Avoid Mistakes and Know How to Correct Them

 A good design and use of scripts will make errors less likely, but when they do occur the user should know how to correct them easily without stress or extra steps.

Completing forms and similar tasks is often overwhelming for most users with cognitive and learning disabilities. This includes relatively minor learning disabilities, such as Dyslexia, or attention related disabilities.

Many users with learning disabilities cannot remember numbers, such as those for their post/zip code, Social Security, or credit card. Many users even need to check their phone numbers. This makes entering information slow, and they may need to leave their desks or take breaks.

Also many users have short term memory issues that can make copying text difficult or impossible. For example, you may be able to remember 6 letters in your head at the same time. Someone with an impaired working memory may be able to remember only one or two. This makes them much more likely to make mistakes copying as it requires you to remember the numbers or letter accurately and then return to the same position in the original version (which also requires memory).

Note that this can often be achieved through supporting personalization.

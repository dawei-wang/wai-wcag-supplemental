<p>
  Many users need products that support adaptation and personalization. Users
  should be able to use add-ons and extensions as assistive technology. This
  includes spell checkers, passwords support, support for text-to-speech, and
  synchronized highlighting of the phrase being read.
</p>
<p>
  Personalization can allow the user to select preferred, familiar options from
  a set of alternatives.
</p>
<p>
  Support personalization and simplification when you can. Do not disable
  add-ons and extensions.

title: Help Users Understand What Things are and How to Use Them
---

Not everyone finds learning new things easy, and not everyone can remember new designs. To use a site or application, people need to know what all controls and elements are on each page and how to use them. Fewer people can use sites and applications that require users to figure out how to use controls or interact with the page.

Many users, including users with mild cognitive impairment or dementia cannot easily learn new design metaphors or remember things they learned. Without these skills, it can be much harder or impossible to find what they need, work out what controls do and how to use them.

Many users can be overwhelmed by too many options or too much information. If an individual's reading is slow, then too much information without structure and organization will make it difficult or impossible to use the site.

Using familiar design patterns, terms and symbols is key to helping users who struggle to remember new symbols and design. Users need the following to be familiar:

* The look and interaction: Having controls, links and buttons look and behave like what they are, lets users know what it is and how to use it. As soon as users need to discover the design pattern, some users will be locked out.
* Symbols: Use familiar symbols. For example, people may look for a question mark for help. If you use a different symbol, fewer people will find help.
* Text: Use familiar terms. For example, some people have a limited vocabulary. Uncommon terms may cause them difficulty.
* Element location: Place elements in expected locations. For example, people may look for the search on the top right hand corner of a page. If it is somewhere else, it will be hard to find.
* Getting help: Always make it easy to find help.

Personalization can be extremely useful for designers who want to offer familiarity and flexibility. Familiarity helps users with cognitive and learning disabilities but is often based on the needs of the individual user. Personalization allows users to customize their interface, which is important as what is familiar for one user may not be familiar to another.

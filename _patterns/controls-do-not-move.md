## User need

> Controls do not move unexpectedly as I am using them.

## Description

Make sure controls and content remain in place and do not move, unless the user initiates the movement. 

## How it helps

Sometimes users are about to press a control and the control moves. As a result, users with slow hand-eye coordination and cognitive processing speed may hit the wrong control causing an unwanted action and disorientation. For example, a user prepares to press a button on a video. The orientation changes to landscape and the control moves. Because the user has slow eye tracking or hand-eye coordination, they end up pressing a link to a new video.

Shifting controls and content also can cause cognitive overload and increase mental fatigue. For example, as a user with Traumatic Brain Injury reads content, the content refreshes and an additional article appears above the current content. The article the user is reading moves down. The user becomes disoriented and the application becomes very hard to use or understand. 

## More details

Controls moving unexpectedly includes:

* Links in a list shifting positions
* Orientation changes
* Slow loading of a page that the user thinks is complete

Note that if controls shift because of an action the user, and the user will not be trying to activate a moving control, it is usually not problematic. For example, form controls shift down while a user types text into a text box above the controls or when the user expands a section.

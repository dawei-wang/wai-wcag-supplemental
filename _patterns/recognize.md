<h2 class="coga-5" id="description-48">Description<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#description-48"></a></h2>
<p>
Use common visual hierarchy, design elements, affordances, and patterns that are
familiar to most users.
</p>

<p>
  Many users, such as those with mild cognitive impairment or
  dementia, cannot easily learn and remember new design metaphors.
  Without these skills, it can be much harder or impossible to locate
  desired items to interact with, and to know what interactions may
  do. Users can feel lost or overwhelmed.
</p>
<p>
  Because common design elements are repeated often over a long period
  of use across many sites, users are more likely to recognize the
  interactions needed.
</p>
<p>
For example, a user goes to a site to buy a product. They cannot see 
how to select the item that they want. They may think the site does not allow you to buy or that their computer is broken. 
</p>

<h2 class="coga-5" id="more-details-37">More Details<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#more-details-37"></a></h2>
<p>Common design elements, affordances and patterns include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
    Create a standard Visual Hierarchy - Place elements where the user
    is expecting them, such as:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Search in the top right hand corner in a website;
      </li>
      <li>
        Link to the home page is in the top left hand corner;
      </li>
      <li>Link to ‘contact us’ is in the top navigation;</li>
      <li>Link to the site map is in the footer area;</li>
      <li>Submit button is at the bottom right for a form;</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Uses common design patterns, such as are documented in the ARIA
    authoring best practices or are used in the most popular sites:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Very common navigation design patterns and common icons;
      </li>
      <li>
        A platform spzecific user interface design for navigation
        mechanisms and icons;
      </li>
      <li>
        An adaptive user interface design that can be personalized
        (see above);
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    User interface (design) from a prior version: Allow users to
    revert back to a prior version of the application that they are
    familiar with.
  </li>
        <li>
    Links that look like links and buttons look and act like buttons:
    <ul>
      <li>
        For example, underline links with a standard style throughout
        a page;
      </li>
      <li>Links generally navigate to a new page;</li>
      <li>Buttons generally perform an action;</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 class="coga-5" id="getting-started-16">Getting Started<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#getting-started-16"></a></h2>
<p>
  When deciding pages, select standard components that look and behave
  the way users expect. Use standard conventions for layout such as
  the home link in the upper left corner, navigation at the top,
  search in the upper right, etc. and create an obvious visual
  hierarchy in the page.

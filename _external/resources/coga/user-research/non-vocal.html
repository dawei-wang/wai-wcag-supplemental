	<h4>Non-verbal - Severe Speech and Language impairments</h4>
	<p>Communication Difficulties and Disorders may include non-verbal individuals such as those who have Aphonia with no vocal output, Anarthria where speech musculature is involved and other disabilities that preclude any form of speech and language. The description may also include those with Aphasia who may have receptive and expressive difficulties (see section - Aphasia), Dysarthria and dyspraxia where words may become unintelligible and a wide range of other difficulties that make articulation of accurate sounds difficult, language expression and understanding hard to achieve and vocalization impossible. This can include those who have hearing impairments and cognitive disabilities but in this section the concentration is on those who use Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC).</p>
	<p>"Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) includes all forms of communication (other than oral speech) that are used to express thoughts, needs, wants, and ideas. We all use AAC when we make facial expressions or gestures, use symbols or pictures, or write." <a href="http://www.asha.org/public/speech/disorders/AAC/">American Speech-Language-Hearing Association</a></p>
	<section>
		<h5>Cognitive Functions</h5>
		<p>These may be impaired and affect the choice of symbols and devices used to support communication needs. The impact of severe cognitive impairment affects all aspects of speech and language with possible reduced expressive and receptive abilities. There may be difficulties in the composition of words, phrases and sentences and also the understanding of them whether represented by symbols, gestures or other methods of communication.</p>
	
<p><i>Memory</i><br/>Cognitive impairments may result in impaired short term memory which can impact on learning how to use any symbolic representations of speech such as pictograms and other photographic symbols. This may result in a very reduced number of symbols being used on a daily basis. Lack of Auditory memory affects the ability to gain skills in phonemic awareness that aids literacy skills.  Difficulties with visuo-spatial memory impact on the speed withwhich symbols may be found on a communication board or located on a screen and with physical difficulties this can further slow communication. Procedural memory difficulties result in poor automaticity in terms of Language Acquisition through Motor Planning (LAMP) which is one of the ways individuals can speed their AAC output. </p>

<p><i>Reasoning</i><br/>Where intellectual capacity is affected there may be issues with reasoning, learning and thus remembering plus abstraction.</p>
<p><i>Attention</i><br/>Shortened attention span can occur alongside distractability when other cognitive impairments are present.</p>
<p><i>Language</i><br/>Young AAC users may have difficulty developing good sentence construction for written language in particular if reading skills are poor </p>
<p><i>Speech Perception</i><br/>Cognitive impairments can affect speech perception</p>
<p><i>Understanding Figurative Language</i><br/>Idioms, metaphors, similes and other representations of language that contain abstract notions can cause issues for AAC users</p>
<p><i>Literacy</i><br/>Aquired dyslexia can be an issue with individuals having to relearn how to read, sound out words and remember how to spell.</p>
<p><i>Visual Perception</i><br/>Not recognising letters and words impact on reading and even object recognition can be affected</p> 
<p><i>Other Perception</i><br/>Auditory perceptual difficulties can affect phonemic awareness and any possible speech output</p>
<p><i>Knowledge</i><br/>An AAC user does not necessarily have intellectual difficulties but knowledge can be trapped within the brain if the individual cannot express their thoughts. </p>
<p><i>Behavioral</i><br/>Behaviour can be affected by the inability to communicate with considerable frustration occurring at times.  Individuals may also become depressed and irritable, however these individuals can also show amazing resilience and understanding when issues arise.</p>
<p><i>Consciousness</i><br/>Consciousness in those who have no communication skillscan be difficult to assess</p>

	<section>
		<h5>Symptoms</h5>
		<p><i>Anarthria</i>: Loss of the motor ability that enables speech. Complete loss of the ability to vocalize words as a result of an injury to the part of the brain that is responsible for controlling the larynx.</p>
		<p><i>Aphasia</i>: A disturbance of the comprehension and formulation of language caused by dysfunction in specific brain regions. There may be an inability to read, naming problems (finding the right word to refer to something), mis-articulated words, grammatical errors in speech, difficulty with numerical calculations, slow and effortful speech, inability to compose written language or inability to understand speech.</p>
		<p><i>Apraxia</i>: An acquired oral motor speech disorder affecting an individual's ability to translate conscious speech plans into motor plans.</p>
		<p><i>Autism</i>: A disorder of neural development characterized by impaired social interaction and verbal and non-vocal communication.</p>
		<p><i>Aphonia</i>: The inability to produce voice.</p>
		<p><i>Alalia</i>: A delay in the development or use of the mechanisms that produce speech.</p>
		<p><i>Dyslalia</i>: Difficulties in talking due to structural defects in speech organs.</p>
		<p><i>Developmental verbal dyspraxia</i>: Motor speech disorder involving impairments in the motor control of speech production.</p>
		<p>
			<i>Developmental Disabilties</i>: Fragile X, Down syndrome, pervasive developmental disorders, fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, cerebral palsy.</p>
		<p>
			<i>Intellectual Impairment</i>: traumatic brain injury, lead poisoning, Alzheimer's disease.</p>

			<h5>How Symptoms result in Challenges for Young People who are Non-Verbal</h5>
			<p>Young non-vocal communicators are very often encouraged to make vocal speech and all efforts are made to achieve that goal. There is a persistent idea that if AAC systems are introduced early in a child’s life it will delay or prevent the development of verbal speech. This conclusion is erroneous. Research (<a href="http://www.pecsusa.com/research.php">http://www.pecsusa.com/research.php</a>) has shown that the introduction of AAC early in a child’s life will actually help the child develop verbal speech if that capability exists. The emphasis on making verbal speech still continues after AAC is introduced, but the fact that the child now has a means of communicating means that their right to communicate is already being supported. In situations where Speech and Language Pathologists (SLP) attempt to introduce AAC early the challenge to enlist the family/caregivers as supporters of AAC often fails. In situations where no SLP is available and/or the knowledge that there are relatively inexpensive interventions available and/or the parents/caregivers do not support the system, the child is not supported with an AAC system and expectations fall far short of the child's potential.</p>
			<p> Major Challenges:</p>
			<section>
				<h6>No Support</h6>
				<p>Because very special conditions must be present to support a non-vocal communicator with AAC (resources, knowledge, support) non-vocal people are often not helped to develop even low-tech communication systems. This leads to vastly reduced opportunities for the non-vocal communicator. In individuals for whom functional level prohibits using AAC tools, there are other strategies such as indirect selection, facial expression, vocalizations, gestures, and sign languages.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h6>Non-Interoperability</h6>
				<p>Since high-tech AAC systems almost always have different operating systems and file structures, each time a new device is added someone has to manually re-program the communication system. This non-interoperability problem exists across almost all devices, even extending to multiple devices developed within by a single manufacturer. This is a major challenge facing most non-vocal people using high-tech AAC systems.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h6>Costs of Low-Tech AAC</h6>
				<p>Communication books, symbol sets and software to customize and print icons, activity boards, picture schedules, and other low-tech communication tools are relatively inexpensive as is training for non-vocal people, SLPs, and parents/caregivers. Inexpensive is a relative term, and many communities do not have resources for even the basic tools, but if a basic methodology is employed, then even makeshift tools will enable some communication beyond making sounds, pointing, and gesturing.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h6>Costs of High-Tech AAC</h6>
				<p>High-tech AAC systems are expensive as are extended warranties. The life of a device is usually limited to the life of the extended warranty offered by the manufacturer. This is due not only to the expense involved in supporting an out-of-warranty device but also to the fact that parts become scarce when devices are discontinued and manufacturing stops. Medicare standards (in the US?) prohibit the purchase of a new device until five years from the purchase date of the previous device so insurance companies and institutions follow that pattern. This makes the de-facto life of high-tech AAC devices five years, and this is echoed by manufacturer warranties which typically extend coverage to five years.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h6>Costs of Lack of AAC</h6>
				<p>There are costs associated with failing to implement AAC. These costs include social and health consequences for neuro-typical as well as other communicators. AAC introduces a range of behavior modification techniques for non-neuro-typical individuals. Example: use of a picture schedule creates the opportunity for frictionless transitions in individuals for whom transitions are difficult and who may act out their fears with self-harming or other behaviors.</p>

	<h5>Scenarios and User Stories</h5>

		<section>
			<h6>Young Non-Verbal Woman</h6>
			<p>S is a 21 year old woman with a chromosomal deletion known as Cri-du-chat Syndrome, or Five P Minus (5p-). She is a mosaic; she has the transcription error in approximately 50 percent of her cells, so some of the classic Cri-du-chat symptoms are not present such as congenital heart problems and microcephaly. S has orthopedic impairments, is ataxic (loss of full control of bodily movements) and hypotonic (abnormally low body tone) and she is developmentally disabled. She is also nearly completely non-vocal, but she has a communication system. S uses the Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS) (<a href="http://www.pecsusa.com/pecs.php">http://www.pecsusa.com/pecs.php</a>) as her base methodology and this is invoked in whatever communication book, picture schedule, choice boards, and other low-tech systems she uses. PECS methodology is also used in her high-tech voice output devices. Using PECS as the base methodology supports her with a consistent approach that has allowed her to develop into a very confident communicator. Since she cannot read or write she relies on icons and pictures to navigate and make her communication choices. She has been using a communication book since she was five years old (and still does) and she started using high-tech AAC systems when she was ten years old. All of her high-tech AAC devices have been purchased from a single vendor, and none of them have been interoperable, requiring her communication environment to be created manually at each change of device. None of her other non-vocal classmates/peers have communication systems.</p>
		</section>
		</section>
	<section>
		<h5>How They Use the Web and ICT</h5>
		<p>There are many people who have spoken language communication difficulties who can cope with the use of the web and ICT at a very high level. It can provide their only method for dialogue using e-mail, instant messaging, social media etc. Individuals with cognitive disabilities as well as communication difficulties may on the other hand struggle with elements of Internet usage. They may find the intricacies of navigation, complex content and confusing messaging systems hard to access.</p>
		<p>There remains a lack of suitable systems that are simple enough for symbol users to engage with a wide range of social networks, email and voice systems. Users generally need to use bespoke software that allows for symbol to text and text to symbol conversions. Use of the web is hampered by a lack of symbol based informational sites - simple word to symbol translation does not always solve comprehension problems.</p>
			</section>

	<section>
		<h5>Characteristics of Content Optimized for This Group</h5>
		<p>Those who have developmental speech and language disorders and make use of AAC may have difficulties learning to read or may not have the cognitive capacity to learn to read and so there are considerable challenges producing web content and technologies that can support this user group. However, there are also huge benefits for these individuals if they can access the web in terms of interactive communication and socialisation. Features that can help include</p>
			<ul>
			<li> Bold type for headings and keywords </li>
			<li> Introduce high levels of white space, short paragraphs, larger than usual sans serif fonts and increased line spacing. </li>
			<li> Offer increased sizes for menu buttons and media controls.</li>
			<li> Clear and unambiguous use of images with good contrast levels. </li>
			<li> Simple alternative tags and text explanations for media items. </li>
			<li> Clear short sentence structure with use of concrete concepts for easy reading. </li>
			<li> Use of first person whilst also avoiding conditional tenses. </li>
			<li> Offer speech output for all main content - text to speech or recorded speech files embedded on the website. </li>
			<li> Use colour to delineate areas with logical keyboard accessible navigation</li>
			<li> Static content for the main areas of a website with meaningful use of dynamic content if necessary.</li>
			<li> Increased levels of complexity related to content should be available on secondary pages for those who have higher level literacy skills. </li>
	
		</ul>
	
	</section>
	<section>
		<h5>Specific Technologies</h5>
		<p>Specific technologies that can help those who have communication difficulties vary enormously. They range from simple text to speech that can aid reading ability, the highlighting of text as items are read aloud, enlarged font sizing and different font styles to complex communication aids.</p>
		<p>There are a wide range of systems including unaided AAC systems that do not require an technologies but may include facial expression, vocalizations, gestures, and sign languages. Then there are the low-tech communication aids which may be defined as those that do not need batteries, electricity or electronics such as communication books and boards. High-tech communication systems can include speech generating devices and software for computers, tablets, and smart phones.</p>
		<p>Specific groups of AAC users will use different types of symbols and devices.  They include those with: cerebral palsy, intellectual impairment, autism, developmental verbal dyspraxia, traumatic brain injury (TBI), aphasia, locked-in syndrome, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, dementia.</p>
		<p>Types of symbol AAC methodologies:</p>
		<ul>
			<li> Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS), </li>
			<li> MinSpeak etc </li>
			<li> LAMP </li>
		</ul>
		<p>Symbol sets:</p>
		<ul>
			<li> Bliss symbols </li>
			<li> Symbol Stix </li>
			<li> PCS </li>
			<li> Widgit </li>
			<li> ARASAAC </li>
			<li> Sclera </li>
		</ul>
	</section>
	<section>
	
		<h5>Extent To Which Current Needs Are Met</h5>
		<p>Those who use AAC devices often depend on symbols for communication and may have poor literacy skills or if they do have good literacy skills they may struggle to fill in forms and online documentation due to other physical disabilities. It is essential that there is an understanding of the slowness of interaction that might take place with challenging touch screen, keyboard or switch access. At present very few websites offer:</p>
		<ul>
		
      <li> Integrated speech output to support textual content</li>
			<li> Total keyboard accessibility that can be translated to switch access </li>
			<li> Alternative navigational elements that are clear and large enough for touch screen use</li>
			<li> Chances to adapt the look and feel of pages to suit user needs - font sizing, colour backgrounds, decluttering to aid readability</li>
			<li> Use of colour to aid comprehension and highlight key points. </li>
			<li> Images and icons that can explain content</li>
		</ul>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h5>Potentials and Possibilities</h5>
		
		<p>It is  possible to link to symbol databases to offer options for symbols to appear that can explain the meaning of words.  This system is used by <a href="http://widgit.com/products/point/index.htm">Widgit Online Point</a> There is the problem of words having more than one meaning and several symbols being presented as the system cannot cope with the context of word in a sentence but this will happen in time. </p>
		<p>Browsers and Websites can offer toolbars that allow text to be read aloud with text highlighting, font changing, CSS adaptations and links to services such as <a href="https://readability.com/">Readability</a> </p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h5>Prevalence</h5>
		<p>Between 6 and 8 million people in the U.S. have some form of language impairment. Research suggests that the first 6 months of life are the most crucial to a child's development of language skills. For a person to become fully competent in any language, exposure must begin as early as possible, preferably before school age.</p>
		<p>Approximately 7.5 million people in the United States have trouble using their voices. Spasmodic dysphonia, a voice disorder caused by involuntary movements of one or more muscles of the larynx (voice box), can affect anyone. The first signs of this disorder are found most often in individuals between 30 and 50 years of age. More women than men appear to be affected. Laryngeal papillomatosis is a rare disease consisting of tumors that grow inside the larynx, vocal folds, or the air passages leading from the nose into the lungs. It is caused by the human papilloma virus (HPV). Between 60 and 80 percent of laryngeal papillomatosis cases occur in children, usually before the age of three. Speech Source: Compiled by NIDCD based on scientific publications.</p>
		<p>The prevalence of speech sound disorders in young children is 8 to 9 percent. By the first grade, roughly 5 percent of children have noticeable speech disorders; the majority of these speech disorders have no known cause. By the time they are six months old, infants usually babble or produce repetitive syllables such as "ba, ba, ba" or "da, da, da." Babbling soon turns into a kind of nonsense speech jargon that often has the tone and cadence of human speech, but does not contain real words. By the end of their first year, most children have mastered the ability to say a few simple words. By 18 months of age, most children can say 8 to 10 words. By age 2, most put words together in crude sentences such as "more milk." At ages 3, 4, and 5, a child's vocabulary rapidly increases, and he or she begins to master the rules of language. It is estimated that more than 3 million Americans stutter. Stuttering can affect individuals of all ages, but occurs most frequently in young
			children between the ages of 2 and 6. Boys are 3 times more likely than girls to stutter. Most children, however, outgrow their stuttering, and it is estimated that fewer than 1 percent of adults stutter. <a class="external text" href="http://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/statistics/vsl/Pages/stats.aspx">Compiled by NIDCD based on scientific publications.</a></p>

<section>
		<h6>Communication Disorders</h6>
<p>The American Association of Speech-Language-Hearing Association 
(ASHA) definition for communication disorders is as follows: "A 
communication disorder is an impairment in the ability to receive, send,
 process, and comprehend concepts or verbal, nonverbal and graphic 
symbol systems. A communication disorder may be evident in the processes
 of hearing, language, and/or speech. A communication disorder may range
 in severity from mild to profound. It may be developmental or acquired.
 Individuals may demonstrate one or any combination of communication 
disorders. A communication disorder may result in a primary disability 
or it may be secondary to other disabilities. - See more at: <a href="http://www.asha.org/policy/RP1993-00208/">http://www.asha.org/policy/RP1993-00208/</a>"</p>

		<h6>Cognitive Functions</h6>
		<p>Cognitive function as "an intellectual process by which one becomes aware of, perceives, or comprehends ideas" (<a class="external text" href="http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Cognitive+Function">Mosby, 2009</a>)may
 or may not be tied directly to a communication disorder. An individual 
may have high cognitive functioning and still be unable to communicate.</p>

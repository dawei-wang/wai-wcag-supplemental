	<h4>Down Syndrome</h4>
	<p><b>Down syndrome</b> also known as <b>Trisomy 21</b>, is a genetic disorder caused by the presence of all or part of a third copy of <a class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_21_%28human%29">chromosome 21</a>. It is typically associated with <a class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_development">physical-growth</a> delays, characteristic <a class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysmorphic_feature">facial features</a>, and mild to moderate <a class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_disability">intellectual disability</a>.</p>
	<p>Education and proper care has been shown to improve <a class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life">quality of life</a>. Some children with Down syndrome are educated in typical-school classes, while others require more-specialized education. Some individuals with Down syndrome graduate from high school, and a few attend <a class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-secondary_education">post-secondary education</a>.</p>
	<p>Down syndrome is best known for its effect on the development of literacy and language-related skills. Down syndrome is widely recognized as being a specific learning disability of neurological origin, which does not imply low intelligence or poor educational potential, and which is independent of race and social background.</p>

		<section>
			<h6>Overview</h6>
			<p>Improvements in medical interventions for people with Down syndrome have led to a substantial increase in their life longevity. Diagnosis and treatment of neurological complications are important in maintaining optimal cognitive functioning.</p>
			<p>The cognitive phenotype in Down syndrome is characterized by impairments in morphosyntax, verbal short-term memory, and explicit long-term memory. However, visuospatial short-term memory, associative learning, and implicit long-term memory functions are preserved. Seizures are associated with cognitive decline. They seem to cause additional decline in cognitive functioning, particularly in people with Down syndrome and comorbid disorders, such as autism. Vision and hearing disorders, as well as hypothyroidism, can have a negative impact onn cognitive functioning in people with Down syndrome.</p>
			<p>Dementia that resembles Alzheimer's disease is common in adults with Down syndrome. Early-onset dementia in adults with Down syndrome does not seem to be associated with atherosclerotic complications.</p>

			<h6>Auditory Discrimination</h6>
			<p>People with Down syndrome often struggle with short-term auditory memory. Most people use memory to process, hold, understand, and assimilate spoken language. Auditory memory relates directly to the speed with which words can be articulated, and influences the speed at which people learn new words and learn to read.</p>
			<p>Theories about memory suggest words that are heard are received and stored in working memory to make sense of them. They are then transferred to a more long-term store. However, words are only retained in the working memory for two seconds unless consciously kept there by silently repeating them to oneself, called rehearsing. The amount of information that can be retained within the two-second span is called the auditory digit span.</p>
			<p>Is there a relationship between Down syndrome and working memory?</p>
			<p>Yes, many people with Down syndrome have difficulties in this area. Generally, long-term memory is not impaired. Neither is the visual memory, which is often far stronger.</p>

		</section>
		<section>
			<h6>Visual-Recognition Skills</h6>
			<p>The cognitive profile observed in Down syndrome is typically uneven, with stronger visual than verbal skills; receptive vocabulary stronger than expressive language and grammatical skills; and often strengths in reading abilities. There is considerable variation across the population of people with Down syndrome.</p>
			<p>Many studies have included typically-developing children matched for chronological age, for non-verbal mental age, or on a measure of language or reading ability. Individuals with Down syndrome have also been compared to individuals with learning difficulties of an unknown origin, and to individuals who have learning difficulties of a different aetiology (e.g., specific-language impairment).</p>
			<p>The particular measures of language, reading, or non-verbal ability, used for matching, can affect the conclusion drawn. There are also behavioral aspects of the Down syndrome phenotype other than non-verbal ability and language ability (such as motivational style), which may affect performance on tasks, including attainment tests, and need to be taken into account.</p>
			<p>In terms of education, there is strong evidence to suggest that the relatively-recent policy of educating children with Down syndrome in mainstream schools has had a positive effect on language skills and academic attainments. This means that the findings of studies conducted a number of years ago need to be interpreted with caution.</p>

		<h5>Their Challenges</h5>
		<section>
			<h6>Memory</h6>
			<ul>
				<li>Poor short term memory for facts, events, times, dates, symbols. </li>
				<li>Poor working memory; i.e., difficulty holding on to several pieces of information at the same time. This is especially challenging while undertaking a task, e.g., taking notes while listening, addressing compound questions. </li>
				<li>Mistakes with routine information, e.g., providing age, phone number, or ages of children. </li>
				<li>Inability to hold on to information without referring to notes. </li>
			</ul>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h6>Automatizing skills</h6>
			<p>People with Down syndrome do not tend to automatize skills very well. A high degree of mental effort is required to carry out tasks that other individuals generally do not feel requires effort. This is particularly true when the skill is composed of several sub-skills (e.g., reading and writing).</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h6>Information Processing</h6>
			<ul>
				<li>Difficulties with taking in information efficiently (this could be written or auditory). </li>
				<li>Slow speed of information processing, such as a 'penny dropping' delay between hearing or reading something; and understanding and responding to it. </li>
			</ul>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h6>Communication Skills</h6>
			<ul>
				<li>Lack of verbal fluency and lack of precision in speech (relevant for voice systems). </li>
				<li>Word-finding problems. </li>
				<li>Inability to work out what to say quickly enough. </li>
				<li>Misunderstandings or misinterpretations during oral exchanges. </li>
				<li>Sometimes mispronunciations or a speech impediment may be evident. </li>
			</ul>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h6>Literacy</h6>
			<ul>
				<li>Difficulty in acquiring reading and writing skills. Reading is likely to be slow. </li>
				<li>If people are undiagnosed or diagnosed late, they may be illiterate or barely literate.</li>
				<li>Where literacy has been mastered, problems continue, such as poor spelling; difficulty extracting meaning from written material; difficulty with unfamiliar words; and difficulty with scanning or skimming text. </li>
				<li>Particular difficulty with unfamiliar or new language, such as jargon. </li>
			</ul>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h6>Organization, Sequencing</h6>
			<ul>
				<li>Difficulty organizing a sequence of events. </li>
				<li>Incorrect sequencing of strings of numbers and letters. (passwords, phone numbers) </li>
				<li>Chronic disorganization and misplacing/losing items. </li>
				<li>Difficulty with time management and passage of time. </li>
			</ul>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h6>Navigation</h6>
			<ul>
				<li>Difficulty with finding the way to places or navigating, even within a building. Often get lost. </li>
			</ul>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h6>Sensory Sensitivity</h6>
			<ul>
				<li>Sensitivity to noise and visual stimuli. </li>
				<li>Impaired ability to screen out background noise / movement. </li>
				<li>Sensations of mental overload. </li>
				<li>Tendency to "switch off". </li>
			</ul>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h6>Lack of Awareness</h6>
			<ul>
				<li>Failure to notice body language. </li>
				<li>Failure to realize the consequences of their speech or actions. </li>
			</ul>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h6>Visual Stress</h6>
			<ul>
				<li>Some people may experience visual stress when reading, especially when dealing with large amounts of text. Breaks are often needed. </li>
			</ul>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h6>Coping Strategies</h6>
			<p>It must be emphasized that individuals vary greatly in their Specific Learning Difficulties profile. Key variables are the severity of the difficulties; the ability of individuals to identify and understand their difficulties; and successfully develop and implement coping strategies.</p>
			<p>By adulthood, many people with Specific Learning Difficulties are able to compensate through technology, reliance on others, and an array of self-help mechanisms, the operation of which requires sustained effort and energy. Unfortunately, these strategies are prone to break down under stressful conditions, which impinge on areas of weakness.</p>

			<h6>Effects of Stress</h6>
			<p>People are particularly susceptible to stress (compared with the typical population), resulting in an increase of their impairments.</p>

		<h5>Some Personas with Use Cases That Address Key Challenges</h5>
		<section>
			<h6>Scenario A is a high school student with Down syndrome.</h6>
			<p>Although she can read at a 3rd grade level, reading is slow and difficult. Books geared towards a younger audience with a lot of pictures help. Plus, she can comprehend and remember stories read by others. Test taking is very stressful, It helps when the teacher can help her take the test orally. She is strong on the computer, especially when interested in the topics. She can surf the Web and do research, but needs to be reminded to stay on task and not get distracted by other sites and advertisements. She does not use assistive technology, but has in the past to improve her reading skills. The teacher aide has to remind her to stay on task during exercises. She can do simple research projects, but only if supported with reminders and visual ques.</p>

		<h5>Summary of Existing Research and Guidelines</h5>
		<p>Aim to ensure that written material takes into account the visual stress experienced by some people with Down syndrome, and facilitates ease of reading. Adopting best practice for readers with Down syndrome has the advantage of making documents easier on the eye for everyone. Font. (Remember people with Down syndrome can be easily distracted and confused.)</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Use a plain, evenly-spaced, sans-serif font, such as Arial and Comic Sans. Alternatives include Verdana, Tahoma, Century Gothic, Trebuchet. </li>
			<li>Font size should be 12-14 point. Some people with Down syndrome may request a larger font. </li>
			<li>Use dark-colored text on a light (not white) background. </li>
		</ul>
		<section>
			<h6>Headings and Emphasis</h6>
			<ul>
				<li>Avoid underlining and italics. These tend to make the text appear to run together. Use bold instead. </li>
				<li>AVOID TEXT IN BLOCK CAPITALS. This is much harder to read. </li>
				<li>For headings, use larger font sizes in bold, lower case. </li>
				<li>USe boxes and borders for effective emphasis. </li>
			</ul>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h6>Layout</h6>
			<ul>
				<li>Use left-justified text with a ragged right edge. </li>
				<li>Avoid narrow columns (as used in newspapers). </li>
				<li>Use lines that are not too long: 60 to70 characters. </li>
				<li>Avoid cramping material and using long, dense paragraphs. Space it out. </li>
				<li>Use line spacing of 1.5. </li>
				<li>Avoid starting a sentence at the end of a line. </li>
				<li>Use bullet points and numbering rather than continuous prose. </li>
			</ul>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h6>Writing Style</h6>
			<ul>
				<li>Use short, simple sentences in a direct style. </li>
				<li>Give instructions clearly. Avoid long sentences of explanation. </li>
				<li>Use active rather than passive voice. </li>
				<li>Avoid double negatives. </li>
				<li>Be concise. </li>
			</ul>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h6>Increasing Accessibility</h6>
			<ul>
				<li>Flow charts are ideal for explaining procedures. </li>
				<li>Pictograms and graphics help to locate information. </li>
				<li>Lists of 'do's and 'don't's' are more useful than continuous text to highlight aspects of good practice. </li>
				<li>Avoid abbreviations if possible; or provide a glossary of abbreviations and jargon. </li>
				<li>For long documents, include a contents page at the beginning and an index at the end. </li>
			</ul>
            <p>Note: The spell checker in MS Word can be set to automatically check readability. MS Word will then show the readability score every time spelling is checked. </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Check long documents in sections to determine which parts are too hard to read.</li>
                <li>Flesch Reading Ease score: Rates text on a 100-point scale. The higher the score, the easier it is to understand the document. For most standard documents, aim for a score of approximately 70 to 80. </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level score: Rates text on a U.S. grade-school level. For example, a score of 5.0 means that a fifth grader, i.e., a Year 6, average 10 years old, can understand the document. For most standard documents, aim for a score of approximately 5.0 by using short sentences, not by simplifying vocabulary. </li>

		<h5>Prevalence</h5>
		<p>The estimated incidence of Down syndrome is between 1 in 1,000 to 1 in 1,100 live births worldwide. Each year, approximately 3,000 to 5,000 children are born with this chromosome disorder. It is believed there are about 250,000 families in the United States of America who are affected by Down syndrome.</p>
		<p>Sixty to 80 percent of children with Down syndrome have hearing deficits. Forty to 45 percent of children with Down syndrome have congenital heart disease. Intestinal abnormalities also occur at a higher frequency in children with Down syndrome.</p>
		<p>Children with Down syndrome often have more eye problems than other children who do not have this chromosome disorder. Another concern relates to nutritional aspects. Some children with Down syndrome, in particular those with severe heart disease, often fail to thrive in infancy. On the other hand, obesity is often noted during adolescence and early adulthood. These conditions can be prevented by providing appropriate-nutritional counseling and anticipatory-dietary guidance.</p>
		<p>Thyroid dysfunctions are more common in children with Down syndrome than in other children. Skeletal problems have also been noted at a higher frequency in children with Down syndrome. Other important medical aspects in Down syndrome, including immunologic concerns, leukemia, Alzheimer disease, seizure disorders, sleep apnea, and skin disorders, may require the attention of specialists in their respective fields.</p>

	<h4>Intellectual Disability</h4>
	<p>"Intellectual disability is a condition diagnosed before age 18 that includes below-average intellectual function and a lack of skills necessary for daily living. It is typically characterized by:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Lack of or slow development of motor skills, language skills, and self-help skills, especially when compared to peers</li>
    <li>Failure to grow intellectually or continued infant-like behavior</li>
    <li>Lack of curiosity</li>
    <li>Problems keeping up in school</li>
    <li>Failure to adapt (adjust to new situations)</li>
    <li>Difficulty understanding and following social rules"</li>
    </ul>

	<p>Education and proper care has been shown to improve <a class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life">quality of life</a>. Some children with an intellectual disability are educated in typical-school classes, while others require more-specialized education. Some individuals with intellectual disability graduate from high school, and a few attend <a class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-secondary_education">post-secondary education</a>.</p>
	<p>"Intellectual disabilities" are known as "learning disabilities" or as "learning difficulties" in the United Kingdom. In the United States, "intellectual disability" used to be known as "mental retardation", a term that is no longer used.</p>

			<h6>Overview</h6>
            <p>"One way to measure intellectual functioning is an IQ test. Generally, an IQ test score of around 70 or as high as 75 indicates a limitation in intellectual functioning."</p>  <p>Significant deficits in adaptive behavior are another way to identify people with intellectual disabilities. "Adaptive behavior is the collection of conceptional, social, and practical skills that are learned and performed by people in their everyday lives."</p>
            <ul>
            <li>"Conceptual skills&mdash;language and literacy; money, time, and number concepts; and self-direction.</li>
             <li>Social skills&mdash;interpersonal skills, social responsibility, self-esteem, gullibility, na&iuml;vet&eacute; (i.e., wariness), social problem solving, and the ability to follow rules/obey laws and to avoid being victimized.</li>
             <li>Practical skills&mdash;activities of daily living (personal care), occupational skills, healthcare (sic), travel/transportation, schedules/routines, safety, use of money, use of the telephone.</li>
             </ul>
             <p>Standardized tests can also determine limitations in adaptive behavior.</p>
            <p>This condition is one of serveral (sic) developmental disabilities&mdash;that is, there is evidence of the disability during the developmental period, which in the US is operationalized as before the age of 18."</p>

			<h6>Auditory Discrimination</h6>
			<p>People with intellectual disabilities often struggle with short-term auditory memory. Most people use memory to process, hold, understand, and assimilate spoken language. Auditory memory relates directly to the speed with which words can be articulated, and influences the speed at which people learn new words and learn to read.</p>
			<p>Theories about memory suggest words that are heard are received and stored in working memory to make sense of them. They are then transferred to a more long-term store. However, words are only retained in the working memory for two seconds unless consciously kept there by silently repeating them to oneself, called rehearsing. The amount of information that can be retained within the two-second span is called the auditory digit span.</p>
			<p>Is there a relationship between intellectual disability and working memory?</p>
			<p>Yes, many people with intellectual disabilities have difficulties in this area. Generally, long-term memory is not impaired. Neither is the visual memory, which is often far stronger.</p>

			<h6>Visual-Recognition Skills</h6>
			<p>The cognitive profile observed in intellectual disability is typically uneven, with stronger visual than verbal skills; receptive vocabulary stronger than expressive language and grammatical skills; and often strengths in reading abilities. There is considerable variation across the population of people with intellectual disabilities.</p>
			<p>Many studies have included typically-developing children matched for chronological age, for non-verbal mental age, or on a measure of language or reading ability. Individuals with intellectual disability have also been compared to individuals with learning difficulties of an unknown origin, and to individuals who have learning difficulties of a different aetiology (e.g., specific-language impairment).</p>
			<p>The particular measures of language, reading, or non-verbal ability, used for matching, can affect the conclusion drawn. There are also behavioral aspects of intellectual disability other than non-verbal ability and language ability (such as motivational style), which may affect performance on tasks, including attainment tests, and need to be taken into account.</p>
			<p>In terms of education, there is strong evidence to suggest that the relatively-recent policy of educating children with intellectual disability in mainstream schools has had a positive effect on language skills and academic attainments. This means that the findings of studies conducted a number of years ago need to be interpreted with caution.</p>

		<h5>Their Challenges</h5>
		<section>
			<h6>Memory</h6>
			<ul>
				<li>Poor short term memory for facts, events, times, dates, symbols. </li>
				<li>Poor working memory; i.e., difficulty holding on to several pieces of information at the same time. This is especially challenging while undertaking a task, e.g., taking notes while listening, addressing compound questions. </li>
				<li>Mistakes with routine information, e.g., providing age, phone number, or ages of children. </li>
				<li>Inability to hold on to information without referring to notes. </li>
			</ul>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h6>Automatizing skills</h6>
			<p>People with intellectual disability do not tend to automatize skills very well. A high degree of mental effort is required to carry out tasks that other individuals generally do not feel requires effort. This is particularly true when the skill is composed of several sub-skills (e.g., reading and writing).</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h6>Information Processing</h6>
			<ul>
				<li>Difficulties with taking in information efficiently (this could be written or auditory). </li>
				<li>Slow speed of information processing, such as a 'penny dropping' delay between hearing or reading something; and understanding and responding to it. </li>
			</ul>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h6>Communication Skills</h6>
			<ul>
				<li>Lack of verbal fluency and lack of precision in speech (relevant for voice systems). </li>
				<li>Word-finding problems. </li>
				<li>Inability to work out what to say quickly enough. </li>
				<li>Misunderstandings or misinterpretations during oral exchanges. </li>
				<li>Sometimes mispronunciations or a speech impediment may be evident. </li>
			</ul>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h6>Literacy</h6>
			<ul>
				<li>Difficulty in acquiring reading and writing skills. Reading is likely to be slow. </li>
				<li>If people are undiagnosed or diagnosed late, they may be illiterate or barely literate.</li>
				<li>Where literacy has been mastered, problems continue, such as poor spelling; difficulty extracting meaning from written material; difficulty with unfamiliar words; and difficulty with scanning or skimming text. </li>
				<li>Particular difficulty with unfamiliar or new language, such as jargon. </li>
			</ul>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h6>Organization, Sequencing</h6>
			<ul>
				<li>Difficulty organizing a sequence of events. </li>
				<li>Incorrect sequencing of strings of numbers and letters. (passwords, phone numbers) </li>
				<li>Chronic disorganization and misplacing/losing items. </li>
				<li>Difficulty with time management and passage of time. </li>
			</ul>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h6>Navigation</h6>
			<ul>
				<li>Difficulty with finding the way to places or navigating, even within a building. Often get lost. </li>
			</ul>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h6>Sensory Sensitivity</h6>
			<ul>
				<li>Sensitivity to noise and visual stimuli. </li>
				<li>Impaired ability to screen out background noise / movement. </li>
				<li>Sensations of mental overload. </li>
				<li>Tendency to "switch off". </li>
			</ul>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h6>Lack of Awareness</h6>
			<ul>
				<li>Failure to notice body language.</li>
				<li>Failure to realize the consequences of their speech or actions. </li>
			</ul>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h6>Visual Stress</h6>
			<ul>
				<li>Some people may experience visual stress when reading, especially when dealing with large amounts of text. Breaks are often needed.</li>
			</ul>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h6>Coping Strategies</h6>
			<p>It must be emphasized that individuals vary greatly in their Specific Learning Difficulties profile. Key variables are the severity of the difficulties; the ability of individuals to identify and understand their difficulties; and successfully develop and implement coping strategies.</p>
			<p>By adulthood, many people with Specific Learning Difficulties are able to compensate through technology, reliance on others, and an array of self-help mechanisms, the operation of which requires sustained effort and energy. Unfortunately, these strategies are prone to break down under stressful conditions, which impinge on areas of weakness.</p>

			<h6>Effects of Stress</h6>
			<p>People are particularly susceptible to stress (compared with the typical population), resulting in an increase of their impairments.</p>

		<h5>Some Personas with Use Cases That Address Key Challenges</h5>
		<section>
			<h6>Scenario A is a high school student with intellectual disability.</h6>
			<p>Although she can read at a 3rd grade level, reading is slow and difficult. Books geared towards a younger audience with a lot of pictures help. Plus, she can comprehend and remember stories read by others. Test taking is very stressful, It helps when the teacher can help her take the test orally. She is strong on the computer, especially when interested in the topics. She can surf the Web and do research, but needs to be reminded to stay on task and not get distracted by other sites and advertisements. She does not use assistive technology, but has in the past to improve her reading skills. The teacher aide has to remind her to stay on task during exercises. She can do simple research projects, but only if supported with reminders and visual ques.</p>

		<h5>Summary of Existing Research and Guidelines</h5>
		<p>Aim to ensure that written material takes into account the visual stress experienced by some people with intellectual disability, and facilitates ease of reading. Adopting best practice for readers with intellectual disability has the advantage of making documents easier on the eye for everyone. Font. (Remember people with intellectual disability can be easily distracted and confused.)</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Use a plain, evenly-spaced, sans-serif font, such as Arial and Comic Sans. Alternatives include Verdana, Tahoma, Century Gothic, Trebuchet. </li>
			<li>Font size should be 12-14 point. Some people with intellectual disability may request a larger font. </li>
			<li>Use dark-colored text on a light (not white) background. </li>
		</ul>
		<section>
			<h6>Headings and Emphasis</h6>
			<ul>
				<li>Avoid underlining and italics. These tend to make the text appear to run together. Use bold instead. </li>
				<li>AVOID TEXT IN BLOCK CAPITALS. This is much harder to read. </li>
				<li>For headings, use larger font sizes in bold, lower case. </li>
				<li>Use boxes and borders for effective emphasis. </li>
			</ul>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h6>Layout</h6>
			<ul>
				<li>Use left-justified text with a ragged right edge. </li>
				<li>Avoid narrow columns (as used in newspapers). </li>
				<li>Use lines that are not too long: 60 to70 characters. </li>
				<li>Avoid cramping material and using long, dense paragraphs. Space it out. </li>
				<li>Use line spacing of 1.5. </li>
				<li>Avoid starting a sentence at the end of a line. </li>
				<li>Use bullet points and numbering rather than continuous prose. </li>
			</ul>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h6>Writing Style</h6>
			<ul>
				<li>Use short, simple sentences in a direct style. </li>
				<li>Give instructions clearly. Avoid long sentences of explanation. </li>
				<li>Use active rather than passive voice. </li>
				<li>Avoid double negatives. </li>
				<li>Be concise. </li>
			</ul>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h6>Increasing Accessibility</h6>
			<ul>
				<li>Flow charts are ideal for explaining procedures. </li>
				<li>Pictograms and graphics help to locate information. </li>
				<li>Lists of 'do's and 'don't's' are more useful than continuous text to highlight aspects of good practice. </li>
				<li>Avoid abbreviations if possible; or provide a glossary of abbreviations and jargon. </li>
				<li>For long documents, include a contents page at the beginning and an index at the end. </li>
			</ul>
            <p>Note: The spell checker in MS Word can be set to automatically check readability. MS Word will then show the readability score every time spelling is checked. </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Check long documents in sections to determine which parts are too hard to read.</li>
                <li>Flesch Reading Ease score: Rates text on a 100-point scale. The higher the score, the easier it is to understand the document. For most standard documents, aim for a score of approximately 70 to 80. </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level score: Rates text on a U.S. grade-school level. For example, a score of 5.0 means that a fifth grader, i.e., a Year 6, average 10 years old, can understand the document. For most standard documents, aim for a score of approximately 5.0 by using short sentences, not by simplifying vocabulary. </li>

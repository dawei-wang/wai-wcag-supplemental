	<h4>Aphasia</h4>
	<p>Communication difficulties may arise as the result of what is commonly known as a stroke.  The type of impairment that results is known as Aphasia due to brain damage, which may cause receptive (comprehension) and expressive (speech and language) difficulties, dysarthria and dyspraxia where words can become unintelligible and a wide range of other difficulties that make articulation of accurate sounds difficult, and even vocalization impossible.</p>
	<p>Aphasia can also impair an individual's ability to name items (finding the right word to 
refer to something), use correct grammar, cope with numerical calculations,and compose written language</p>

	<section>
		<h5>Cognitive Functions</h5>
		

<p><i>Memory</i><br/>Receptive and Expressive Aphasia may result in impaired short term memory which can impact on re-learning language as can the impairment of auditory memory for relearning correct articulation and visual memory that affects reading and writing.  Visuo-spatial Memory maybe an issue with the inability to remember how to get to places and recall locations, not helped if procedural memory is also involved where the order of doing things is affected. This is usually automatic but actions may have to be relearnt and there can be involvement of prospective memory that involves being aware of when certain activities have to be performed. </p>

<p><i>Reasoning</i><br/>Where intellectual capacity is affected there may be issues with reasoning, learning and thus remembering plus abstraction.</p>
<p><i>Attention</i><br/>Shortened attention span can occur with Aphasia.</p>
<p><i>Language</i><br/>Aphasia can cause difficulties with word finding, the meanings of words and sentences, grammar and comprehension affecting the ability to communicate.</p>
<p><i>Speech Perception</i><br/>Individuals may have difficulties coping with the sounds that make up speech being unable to interpret their meaning which affects understanding and speech output.</p>
<p><i>Understanding Figurative Language</i><br/>Idioms, metaphors, similes and other representations of language that contain abstract notions can cause issues for those with aphasia.</p>
<p><i>Literacy</i><br/>Aquired dyslexia can be an issue with individuals having to relearn how to read, sound out words and remember how to spell.</p>
<p><i>Visual Perception</i><br/>Not recognising letters and words impact on reading and even object recognition can be affected.</p> 
<p><i>Other Perception</i><br/>Auditory perceptual difficulties affect the relearning of speech and recognition of sounds and words impacting on understanding.</p>
<p><i>Knowledge</i><br/>Aphasia does not necessarily impact on intelligence but knowledge will be trapped within the brain if the individual cannot express their thoughts. </p>
<p><i>Behavioral</i><br/>Behaviour can be affected by lability where there can be unnatural emotions including depression. Tiredness can impact on the ability to cope with day to day activities.</p>
<p><i>Consciousness</i><br/>Consciousness in those who have deep Aphasia with no communication can be difficult to assess.</p>

		<h5>Symptoms</h5>
		
		<p><i>Aphasia</i><br/>A disturbance of the comprehension and formulation 
of language caused by dysfunction in specific brain regions. The range of difficulties are very varied from total lack of the ability to communicate using speech and language to halting speech with misinterpretation of complex sentences.  It can also include: </p>
<p><i>Dysarthria</i><br/> Loss of the motor ability that enables speech. Slurring, mispronunciation of words</p>
		<p><i>Aquired Dyspraxia</i><br/> Motor speech disorder involving impairments in the motor control of speech production and an inability to copy correct articulation or plan how to say a word.</p>
		<p><i>Perseveration</i><br/>Uncontrolled repetition of words or phrases</p>
		<p><i>Jargon</i><br/>Inappropriate or incomprehensible words or phrases used without the individual realising they are not making sense. </p>

		<h5> Challenges</h5>
	
				<p>Aphasia can affect any aspect of language -- reading, writing, 
speaking or listening, or combinations of these abilities. However, 
difficulty in reading is probably the symptom that most impacts use of 
the web, because most websites do not make heavy demands on the other 
language-related skills. Minimal writing, such as form-filling, is 
common on websites, but extensive writing, such as a product review or 
blog comment, is usually optional. Speaking is rarely required for 
interacting with a conventional website. It may be used in websites that
 support real-time human-human communication, but then a human is 
present who can make an extra effort to understand someone who doesn't 
speak fluently. Speaking, however, is often required in telephone voice 
applications. Using the keypad as an alternative to voice may also be 
difficult for some people with aphasia <span class="new">due to motor problems which may be the result of a brain injury. </span>Listening is required for 
websites where audio or video material is presented. Closed-captioning 
is not necessarily an option because many people with aphasia are unable
 to read. Many people with aphasia have some degree of hemiplegia, 
associated with the brain injury that affected their language. This 
means that using a mouse or keyboard can be difficult, so typing is not 
necessarily available as an alternative. In addition to difficulty 
reading text, some people with aphasia find certain websites confusing, 
for example, if there's too much material.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h5>Variability of Symptoms of Aphasia</h5>
				<p>Another aspect of aphasia that impacts web accessibility is that 
the symptoms of aphasia vary considerably from person to person, and 
even in the same person from day to day. For example, some people with 
aphasia find that reading text for 15 or 20 minutes is ok, then the 
"brain shuts down". However, for some people reading is unaffected. Some
 people with aphasia can speak fairly well, but some don't talk at all. 
Specific aspects of reading might be differentially affected, for 
example, numbers, or people's names.</p>

		<h5>Scenarios and User Stories</h5>
		<section>
			
			<h6>Professional Man with Aphasia</h6>
			<p>Mr C was a highly skilled accountant before he suffered a stroke, 
he read widely and enjoyed using technology for both his work and 
leisure activities. After a severe left sided brain haemorrhage he not 
only could not speak clearly and had difficulty understanding 
conversation, but he also found that he could not read or write in a 
recognizable way. He found it hard to concentrate and when trying to use
 the Internet he did not have the skills to search for things of 
interest let alone read the content of the web pages. He was extremely 
frustrated, found himself breaking down. It was extremely distressing 
for his family. Slowly words returned and reading skills improved but he
 found the clutter on the screen exasperating and often failed to select
 the correct link or menu item. As he progressed in his rehabilitation, 
he was able to read slowly and made limited use of text to speech and 
increased font sizing. However, he tired easily, complained of eye 
strain and would often give up if he could not find something he was 
searching for. He could not cope with <a class="external text" href="http://www.captcha.net/">CAPTCHA</a>
 technology, found form filling difficult and would often buy the wrong 
items on Amazon by accident. However, with support and using simple 
technologies to de-clutter web sites, so that the text was clear without
 advertisements and excessive imagery Mr. C continued to take up the 
challenge of reading from the screen and his skills slowly improved. 
Eventually he was able to make use of social networks with friends who 
understood his difficulties and enjoyed asynchronous communication where
 he did not have to answer immediately and could take his time reading 
and composing messages.</p>

		<h5>How They Use the Web and ICT</h5>
				<p>People with aphasia use the web to shop, get information, 
communicate with others, and be entertained. These tasks involve the 
language abilities affected by aphasia (listening, speaking, reading and
 writing), although to different extents. Tasks like shopping, getting 
information and being entertained typically heavily involve reading, 
with some writing required for form-filling. Communicating with others 
via email or social networking requires both reading and writing. People
 with aphasia who have difficulties with spoken language may find it 
hard to understand the audio tracks of videos. Speaking is very rarely 
required for interacting with a traditional website, so speaking 
difficulties are unlikely to impact web usage by people with aphasia. 
Telephone voice applications, on the other hand, are likely to be very 
difficult to use for people whose speech is affected.</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h5>Characteristics of Content Optimized for This Group</h5>
		<p>Impairments in reading ability affect many aspects of web usage. We
 can separate reading tasks into reading multiple paragraphs of 
informative text and reading captions on form items. Paragraphs of 
informative text can be made easier to read through general techniques 
that improve readability, such as simpler language, well-structured 
layout and organization, use of white space, and typography that 
enhances legibility. Form filling also requires reading, but in a 
different way. The purpose of reading the caption on a form is to 
understand what the user has to do to provide the correct information 
for the form. Form captions need to be simple and clear. The user should
 be able to hear as well as see the caption on a form as needed, even 
repeating the audio several times if necessary. Well-designed icons can 
also supplement text and audio captions. The user should also be able to
 hear their own input, since some people with aphasia can write but not 
read. <span class="new">Optional and required form fields should be clearly distinguished.</span></p>
		<ul>
			<li> Important points are short with no ambiguity and may need to be highlighted with images and boxed. </li>
			<li> Each point is made in a clear order so it tells a story. </li>
			<li> Sentences are in first person where possible and use easy to understand words. </li>
			<li> Numbers are kept in numerical format unless large and unwieldy when they also need to be in written form. </li>
			<li> Increased amounts of white space and 14 point or larger sans serif fonts are used. </li>
			<li> Bold type for headings and keywords </li>
			<li> Colour can be used to link items </li>
			<li> Pictures are of good quality and clearly represent what is being discussed. </li>
			<li> Keep to one style for all items with clear logical navigation </li>
		</ul>
		<p>Below is the direct quote from T. A. Rose, et. al. (2012) [[Rose-2]].</p>
		<ul>
			<li> Numbers: Present smaller numbers as ﬁgures. </li>
			<li> Present larger numbers (e.g., 40,000) in both ﬁgures and words. </li>
			<li> Present fractions in words. </li>
			<li> People with aphasia may have a clear preference regarding which 
representation (i.e., ﬁgures or words) they consider easier to read, 
and should be provided with the option to choose, where possible. </li>
			<li> Font size and typeface: Use a minimum 14-point font. </li>
			<li> Use a san serif font (e.g., Verdana or Arial). </li>
			<li> Use a font that is clear and bold. </li>
			<li> Line spacing and blank space: Use 1.5 or double line spacing for paragraphs. </li>
			<li> Ensure blank space is included around sections of text. </li>
			<li> Document length: People with aphasia may want several pages of information if it is presented in a simpliﬁed format. </li>
			<li> Preferences for document length may not be related to the 
recipient ’ s reading ability or aphasia severity, and the recipient 
’ s preference for amount of information should be ascertained. </li>
			<li> Graphics: Include graphics, preferably photographs. </li>
			<li> Check preferences for the inclusion of graphics and preferences 
for graphic type, particularly when developing written information for 
people with more severe reading difﬁculties. </li>
			<li> Ensure all graphics relate to the text and are labelled. </li>

		<h5>Specific Technologies</h5>
		<p>Specific technologies that can help those who have communication 
difficulties vary enormously. They range from simple text to speech that
 can aid reading ability, the highlighting of text as items are read 
aloud, enlarged font sizing and different font styles to complex 
communication aids.</p>
		<p>Those who have Aphasia may find it helpful to use the reading aids 
mentioned above and those who cannot communicate with text may need to 
use symbols or pictograms or other forms of augmentative and alternative
 communication (AAC). (See non-verbal section) </p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h5>Extent To Which Current Needs Are Met</h5>
		<p>It entirely depends on the degree to which an individual is able to
 use language both written and spoken, expressive and receptive but it 
is clear that those who have considerable communication disorders with 
minimal literacy skills will have difficulty accessing web pages and 
coping with navigation within and between sites. To this extent there 
are considerable gaps that need to be bridged including:</p>
		<ul>
			<li> lack of clear navigational elements - guidance should not just 
be about screen reader and keyboard access but also about usability </li>
			<li> clutter around main content - guidance needs to ensure increased
 use of white space where it can be used to highlight key points </li>
			<li> poor headings, paragraph structures - guidance needs to 
highlight how use of markers for these elements such as icons, bold text
 and consistent spacing can help understanding </li>
			<li> poor summarising of content - guidance to authors to ensure they provide overview of content in clear fashion </li>
			<li> use of colour to aid comprehension - guidance to ensure sites 
maintain a consistent style if this method for key points is used. </li>
			<li> addition of media elements - guidance to access players and use of captions with summaries can help all users. </li>
		</ul>

		<h5>Potentials and Possibilities</h5>
		<p>"People with aphasia comprehended significantly more 
aphasia-friendly paragraphs than control paragraphs. They also 
comprehended significantly more paragraphs with each of the following 
single adaptations: simplified vocabulary and syntax, large print, and 
increased white space. Although people with aphasia tended to comprehend
 more paragraphs with pictures added than control paragraphs, this 
difference was not significant. No significant correlation between 
aphasia severity and the effect of aphasia-friendly formatting was 
found. " <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02687030444000958">http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02687030444000958</a></p>

best judge of whether a website is good or bad in terms of clarity, 
layout etc for someone who has Aphasia. (Carlye Ghidella, Stephen

		<h5>Prevalence</h5>
		<p>Anyone can acquire aphasia (a loss of the ability to use or understand language), but most 
people who have aphasia are in their middle to late years. Men and women
 are equally affected. It is estimated that approximately 80,000 
individuals acquire aphasia each year. About 1 million persons in the 
U.S. currently have aphasia. Although estimating the prevalence of 
aphasia is difficult, especially in the developing world, aphasia is 
estimated to affect about 0.4 percent of the population. "This year 
130,000 people in the UK will have a stroke. One-third of those who 
survive will have aphasia. Surprisingly, there are currently about 
250,000 people with aphasia in the UK alone." [[Connect-1]]<a href="http://www.ukconnect.org/aphasiaquestionsandanswers_302.aspx"></a></p>

		<h6>Communication Disorders</h6>
<p>The American Association of Speech-Language-Hearing Association 
(ASHA) definition for communication disorders is as follows: "A 
communication disorder is an impairment in the ability to receive, send,
 process, and comprehend concepts or verbal, nonverbal and graphic 
symbol systems. A communication disorder may be evident in the processes
 of hearing, language, and/or speech. A communication disorder may range
 in severity from mild to profound. It may be developmental or acquired.
 Individuals may demonstrate one or any combination of communication 
disorders. A communication disorder may result in a primary disability 
or it may be secondary to other disabilities. - See more at: <a href="http://www.asha.org/policy/RP1993-00208/">http://www.asha.org/policy/RP1993-00208/</a>"</p></section>
<section>	
		<h6>Cognitive Functions</h6>
		<p>Cognitive function as "an intellectual process by which one becomes aware of, perceives, or comprehends ideas" [[Mosby-1]] may
 or may not be tied directly to a communication disorder. An individual 
may have high cognitive functioning and still be unable to communicate.</p>

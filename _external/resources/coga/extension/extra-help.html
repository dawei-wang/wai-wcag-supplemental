  <strong>What Principle and Guideline the SC falls within.</strong></p>
		        <p><br>
		          Principle 3, Help users avoid and correct mistakes. Guideline 3.3 &ldquo;Input Assistance&rdquo;</p>
		        <h2><br>
  <strong>Description</strong></h2>
	<p>It is hard to find a user interface design that is obvious to all users. Human help or beginners help gives flexibility and support to people who are struggling with the interface.</p>
	<p>Beginner's help is useful for people who are new to using the Internet or for people who learn slowly or have an impaired memory and therefore do not remember terms and design.<br></p>
	<p>Help content enables a user to conveniently access information needed to understand how to use the website effectively. Users who need help are usually already confused so help content should be clear and simple. </p>
               <p>Human help includes: </p>
                <ul>
                  <li> Live help option. Note: It must be easy and clear to close the window. </li>
		</ul>
                <ul>
                  <li> A phone number that will automatically call via an interoperable Voice over IP specification. </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                  <li> A simple contact us form. </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                  <li> Use available standards to get human help such as using the 0 digit on voice menu systems. </li>
                </ul>

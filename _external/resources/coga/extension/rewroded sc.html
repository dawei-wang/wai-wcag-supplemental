<h4>Provide a clear structure that includes:</h4>
  <ol>
    <li> Headings and labels are provided that describe the topic or purpose of each section and are <em>easy to find</em>. (COGA Techniques 2.1.2). </li>
    <li>  The main task of each page is clarified though the presentation, main heading and page title. Extraneous information is separated or progmatically determinable. </li>
    <li>Structure and relationships are  obvious such that over 90% of users can immediately identity the structure and relationships (COGA Techniques 2.1.1) </li>
    <li>Lists are used appropriatly (COGA Techniques 2.1.1)  </li>
    <li>Information is provided in manageable chunks, that include: 
      <ol>
        <li>One idea per paragraph. (One sentence is enough for a paragraph.) </li>
        <li>Have one point per sentence. Long sentences can often be broken up into short sentences or lists. If a sentence can use more than two clauses, it typically can be broken up. </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Media that is over five minuets is divided into programmatically determinable  and logical sections. Each section must be navigable to and provided with a unique label that describes the section. (removed For multi media, the user can directly navigate to each  section of the content. )</li>
  </ol>
  <h4><strong>Provide a</strong> predictable design within a set of pages that includes:</h4>
  <p>(see COGA Techniques 2.4) </p>
  <ul>
    <li>A consistent layout of common elements </li>
    <li>Consistent use of icons and controls such that the same icons and buttons serve the same function. Interactive controls with the same role are consistently presented across a set of web pages </li>
    <li>Consistent styles are used for the <a>same type of information</a> (COGA Techniques 2.1.1). </li>
    <li>The standard layout design and common icons are easily available. </li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Provide a clear and understandable layout  that includes:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li> Paragraphs are clearly separated  (white space in text or by a pause in speech content)</li>
    <li> Check use of appropriate punctuation between numbers when providing times as these may be read inappropriately by text to speech engines. (Example time)</li>
    <li>Provide a clear font or voice. A clear font or voice is one that is:
      <ul>
        <li>backed up by user research where coga users are part of the user testing or, </li>
        <li>identified in a known WCAG technique or, </li>
        <li>identified by the user preferences (preferred). </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <h4>Interactive controls are visually clear or visually clear controls are <a>easily available</a> that conform to the following:</h4>
  <p>(See COGA Techniques 2.3) </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Interactive controls are persivable in the modality of the user</li>
    <li>Interactive controls including links are visually discriminable and their boundaries are  clear in the modality of the user. Boundaries on interactive controls and boundaries of icons should have a sufficient color contrast of 1.5 (visual only). 
    </li>
    <li>The qualities or properties of the control define its possible uses. It is clear how it can or should be used and what action it will trigger. Actions and actionable items that can be interacted with should have a clear visual style that indicates how to interact with them e.g. buttons that look like buttons. Visually clear controls can be made easily available though easy to use personlization (when available) </li>
  </ol>
  <div class="technique">
    <p>Techniques include: additional controls are under a sub menu item such as a button that reads "show toolbar" Technique will include: </p>
    <ol>
      <li> Using techniques like 'flat design' with great care as they have reduced affordances. </li>
      <li> the web author needs to define buttons and the OS has a setting called show clear buttons, </li>
      <li> failure when a scroll bard is embedded in another scrollabel region and it is unclear what scroll to use. failure when scrolls are low contrast. </li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  </p>
  <ol>
    <ol>
      <li><em>Critical features</em> and <em>important information </em>can be used without use of a scroll bar. (Example -above the scroll or a clear link to it is above the scroll )</li>
      <li><em>Critical features</em> and important information to the user are visually differentiated and accentuated or  appear before the other main content      </li>
      <li>A clear navigational path is provided to all content such that:

        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Help and support page or function should be reachable with one user interaction. When human help is available the correct contact information or mechanism should be reachable within two user interactions. (Removed: Where human help is provided, it is available via one clearly labeled action for each <a>web related modality</a> for which the help is available.)</li>
      <li>Provide a search box. Exception is provided were adding a search box is a significant expense for the site </li>

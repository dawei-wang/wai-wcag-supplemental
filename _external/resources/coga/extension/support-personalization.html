        <h2>What Principle and Guideline the SC falls within.</h2>
        <p>This could fall under: </p>
        <p>WCAG 1 Perceivable -  Guidline 1.3  Create content that can be presented in different ways (for example simpler layout) without losing information or structure</p>
        <p>Or under: </p>
        <p>WCAG 3 Understandable - Guidline 3.2 Make Web pages appear and operate in predictable ways.</p>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The intent of this success cryteria is to support  user  preferences or needs of the user. For example, having familiar terms   and symbols is key to being able to use the web. However what is   familiar for one user may be new for another requiring them to learn new   symbols. Personalization could include loading a set of symbols that is   appropriate for the specific user, ensuring that all users find the   icons simple and familiar.<br>
Technology holds the  promise of being extremely flexible and the design   of many systems includes the  expectation that users will be able to   optimise their interaction experience  according to their personal   preferences or accessibility  requirements (needs).</p>
        <h2>Benefits</h2>
        <div>
          <div>
            <p>This Success Criterion helps users who need extra support or a familure interface. This can include: </p>
            <ul>
              <li> Symbols and graphics that they are familiar with </li>
              <li> Tool tips </li>
              <li> Language they understand </li>
              <li> Less features </li>
              <li> Separating advertisements, so they do not confuse them with native content </li>
              <li> Keyboard short cuts </li>
            </ul>
            <p>We need personalization  because: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Different user needs can conflict </li>
              <li>Learning new design patterns (and widgets) can  be confusing - we want to allow users to stick with what works for them </li>
              <li>Extra support can be annoying to people who do  not need it </li>
              <li>Making content predictable is necessary for  accessibility but can often be considered boring design </li>
              <li>Ability to change levels of complexity (increase  or decrease) - As people skills improve or decrease over time or context. </li>
              <li>Enable us to really meet the user needs </li>
            </ul>
            <p>This helps people with many diffrent cognitive disabilities including people with: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Language related disabilities </li>
              <li>Memory related disabilities </li>
              <li>Focus and attention related disabilities </li>
              <li>Disabilities that effects  executive function and decision making </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Togther this can effect 11% of school age people and over half of people over 60 years old - including mild cognative imparment an Age-Associate Memory Impairment (<em>AAMI</em>).</p>
            <p>Research on these benefits can be found at  [<cite><a href="#bib-cudd-1" class="bibref">cudd-1</a></cite>] and the task forces <a href="https://rawgit.com/w3c/coga/master/issue-papers/personalization-preferences.html">issue-papers on personalization and preferences</a>. Also see the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/ayelet-seeman/coga.personalisation/tree/ExampleWebPage/">example of an adaptive page</a>.</p>
            <p>An example is a user can be a person growing older whose ability to learn new things has slowed down. This includes learning new interfaces, symbols and designs. They also rely on tool tips. So long as the design is on they know they can use the application and stay in the work force. When the interfaces change, they tryand learn the new interface, but the cognitive load becomes to great and they need to retire. </p>
<p> Another example: 

"Research has shown that dementia changes a person's perception of distances, objects, and colours. Dementia can reduce or remove the ability to see colours from the blue to purple end of the spectrum. Decorative patterns can 'strobe' and possibly confuse or unsettle people. Even something as simple as a silver strip between different floor coverings in a doorway can appear to a person with dementia like something threatening, such as a step or a hole."

        <h2>Testability</h2>
        <p><strong>General test</strong></p>
        <p>For HTML and Web Content</p>
        <p>Step 1. Identify the role of elements</p>
        <p>Step 2. Identify the context of  regions and controls </p>
        <p>Step 3. Check that the context and role is clear from the markup - if not add the role and context from native HTML, ARIA and COGA (where it is supported)</p>
        <p>Step 4. Ensure content conforms to those standards where they can be used for personlisation or additional support.and set the applicable auther settable properties</p>
        <p></p>
        <h2>Techniques</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Techniques include: </strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Use semantics and standardized techniques to provide extra help (<a href="https://rawgit.com/w3c/coga/master/techniques/index.html">COGA Techniques</a> 4.1).</li>
          <li>Provide semantics that symbols on key content (<a href="https://rawgit.com/w3c/coga/master/techniques/index.html">COGA Techniques</a> 4.2)</li>
          <li>Enable user agents to find the version of the content that best fits their needs.</li>
          <li>Use of aria-invalid and aria-required</li>
          <li>Use of aria epub on document content</li>
          <li>Use of aria landmarks - but with coga context where supported </li>
        </ul>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>An alternative way to word this would be to require personalization support for a full list of items, such as familiar icons, text, simplification , less options, extra help etc. This seemed more scary for authors and would limit the form of personalization away from how the user wants specific information handled. However it may be worth revising.</p>

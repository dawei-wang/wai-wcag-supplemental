<h1>Plain language (A)</h1>
<p><strong>Plain language:</strong> Provide clear and simple language in instructions, labels, navigational elements, and error messages, which require a response to continue, so that all of the following are true.</p>
<p><strong>For instructions, labels, and navigational elements:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Simple tense:</strong> Use present tense and active voice. (See exceptions for different context and language.) </li>
  <li><strong>Simple, clear, and common words:</strong> Use words or phrases that are  most-frequently used for the current context, unless it will result in a loss of meaning or clarity. This includes not using abbreviations, words, or phrases, unless they are the common form to refer to concepts for beginners. Where word frequencies are known for the context, they can be used. </li>
  <li><strong>Double negatives</strong> are not used.</li>
  <li><strong>Concrete language: </strong><em>Non-literal language</em> is not used, or can be automatically replaced, via an easy-to-set user setting. All meaning must be retained when non-literal text is replaced.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Also on controls:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>The words on controls and labels identify an element's function.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Also on instructions:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Each step in instructions is identified, and  <em>literal wording</em>  is used.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Exceptions:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>When a passive voice or a tense (other than present tense) is clearer. Other voices or tenses may be used when it has been shown, via user testing, to be easier to understand, friendlier, or appropriate.</li>
  <li>In languages  where present tense and active voice do not exist, or are  not clearer in the language of the content, use the tense and the voice that are clearest  for the content.</li>
  <li>When describing or discussing past or future events, the present tense is not required.</li>
  <li>If the writing style is an essential part of the main function of the site, such as a game, a literary work, or teaching new terms.</li>
  <li>Where less-common words are found to be easier  to understand for the audience. Such findings are supported by <em>user testing</em> that includes users with cognitive disabilities. </li>
  <li>The writing-style items may be replaced for a location or a type of content in which user testing has shown a more-effective writing style to aid comprehension for people with cognitive disabilities. Example: content written in a specific natural language.</li>
  <li>The content will  be penalized for not conforming to a given writing style (such as a <abbr title="Curriculum Vitae">CV</abbr>, dissertation, or <abbr title="Doctor of Philosophy">Ph.D.</abbr> proposal).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The  <strong>intent</strong>  of this success criterion is to ensure  people can understand and use   navigational elements, user interfaces, and  instructions. Clear language for  all content is an important accessibility principle. However, if the user does not understand words and terms in these critical areas, the whole application or web site often becomes unusable.</p>
<p>A real-life example is  a person, with mild dementia, trying to use an application to turn on a heating and air conditioning unit. The menu item for selecting heat or air conditioning is labeled &quot;mode&quot;. The user does not know that &quot;mode&quot; refers to heat or to air conditioning, and thus cannot use the whole unit because of this one term. </p>
<p>In this real-life example (reported by a task force member), a visitor turned on an air conditioner and did not turn it off when leaving the dwelling. The weather became a bit cooler. The user, who could not turn on the heat because of the language used, became hypothermic, and needed emergency treatment.</p>
<p>People with dementia have impaired short-term memory, and difficulty remembering new information. Therefore, learning and remembering new terms can be impossible. However, if an interface uses familiar terms and design, it is fully usable. Not being able to use these applications mean that more people require live-in help, and lose their independence.</p>
<p>In another example, many task force members cannot use GitHub because the terms it uses are not typical for functions (such as &quot;push&quot; instead of &quot;upload&quot;).</p>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-9beb1966-745c-d8c0-3161-507deb0dbba2">Some users, particularly those on the autism spectrum, will have difficulty with figurative language, as they will try to interpret it literally. This will frequently lead to the user to failing to comprehend the intended meaning, and may instead act as a source of stress and confusion</span>. (Taken from ETSI)</p>
<p>It should be noted that restrictions on scope make it practical from the content providers' perspective, and the <span id="docs-internal-guid-9beb1966-7db4-0f13-9ccd-f30054648dbd">exceptions </span> ensure it is widely applicable. For example, error messages, which require a response to continue, are being included as a level A because, without understanding these messages, the user is completely unable to continue. Error messages, which do not require a response, may be frustrating, but do not always make the whole application unusable.</p>


<h2>Benefits</h2>
<p>This supports those who have reading difficulties, language disabilities, and some visual perceptual difficulties. It can include people with intellectual disabilities, Receptive Aphasia, and/or Dyslexia, as well as those with general cognitive learning disabilities. This supports those who have Dementia, and/or acquire cognitive disabilities as they age.</p>

<h2>Testability</h2>
<p>This success criterion is testable if each of the bullet points are testable. If the content fails any bullet point, it is not conformant to this success criterion. If it passes <strong>all</strong> of the bullet points, it is  conformant. </p>
<p>Bullet points:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Simple tense:</strong>  Use present tense  and active voice. (See exceptions for different context and language.)  </li>
</ul>
<p>Tense and voice are <span id="docs-internal-guid-9beb1966-7e16-f4f4-b345-2bbdad1557f1">objective</span>, and hence are verifiable. (It is expected that natural language processing algorithms will be able to conform to this automatically with reasonable accuracy.)</p>
<p>Testing for exceptions:</p>
<p>If present tense  and  active voice have not been used, the tester will need to confirm if one of the exceptions is relevant. If an exception is not relevant; and present tense  and active voice have not been used; then the content fails this success criterion.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Simple and clear words</strong>:  Use words or phrases most frequently used for the current context, unless this will result in a loss of meaning or of clarity. Where word frequencies are known for the context, they can be used. This includes not using abbreviations, words, and phrases, unless they are the common forms to refer to concepts for beginners.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even languages with a small number of users have published lists of most-frequent words (such as Hebrew). If there is a natural language that does not have such a list, algorithms exist that calculate these lists for  languages, or for specific contexts. Testing content against these word lists can be done manually. However, it is expected there will be a natural language processing testing tool by the time this goes to CR. (It is already integrated into a tool by IBM.)</p>
<p>Testing for exceptions is as discussed above. </p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Double negatives</strong>  are not used.</li>
</ul>
<p>Use of double negatives is a fact, and hence is verifiable. It is assumed a natural language processing tool will also test for this. Testing for exceptions is as discussed above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Literal text:</strong>  Metaphors and  other non-literal text  are not used, or can be automatically replaced via an easy-to-set user setting. All meaning must be retained when  non-literal text  is replaced.</li>
</ul>
<p>Non-literal text, such as metaphors, can be identified when the meaning of the sentence is something other than the meaning of the individual words. This is human testable. Cognitive computing algorithms can test for this as well. </p>
<p>If the text is not literal, then the tester must confirm that personalization and an easy user setting enables it to be replaced, such that all meaning is retained. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Words on controls and labels identify an element's  function.</li>
</ul>
<p>  This can be tested by identifying the function of the control, and checking if it is identified in the label.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Each step of instructions is identified, and  concrete wording  is used.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is human testable by completing the instructions literally, and confirming that the effect is correct.</p>

<h2>SC Short name</h2>
		        <p><strong>Consistent Cues</strong></p>
		        <h2>SC Text</h2>
		        <p> Provide Consistent Cues: 
	            Within a set of web pages, consistent cues are provided that identify different content types, and  the state of elements and regions, which help the user understand their roles or  states.</p>
<h2>Suggestion for Priority Level (A/AA/AAA)</h2>
<p>(AA)</p>
		        <h2>Related Glossary additions or changes</h2>
		        <p>Content types: The type and function of a content element. Content types are typically defined in HTML tag names, ARIA roles, or personalization semantics. </p>
		        <p>Examples include: roles, types of contact information, types of help,  types of functions, warnings, key points, errors, system messages, notes,  definitions, more information, tables of content, site maps, file types, search, required information, errors, opinions,Â essential information, types of transaction, types of reminder, usage  instructions, status of elements, invalid fields, non-native content, and sponsored content.</p>
<h2>What Principle and Guideline the SC falls within.</h2>
		        <p>Principle 3, Guideline 3.3 &ldquo;Input Assistance&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
		        <p>The use of inconsistent cues can present significant barriers to users  with cognitive accessibility needs. The intent of this Success Criterion is to  ensure that navigation, operability, and the ability to complete tasks  associated with a website, are fully supported by consistent cues throughout the  website.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>A user with cognitive  accessibility needs may have difficulty understanding the state of a particular  control if the mechanism for displaying the state of the control is inconsistent  throughout a website.</li>
                  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>If the content type and the format required  by an input field are not clearly defined, users with cognitive accessibility  needs may have difficulty determining the format of the information required.</li>
                </ul>
		        <h2>Benefits</h2>
		        <p>The benefit to users with cognitive accessibility needs is that consistent  cues and prompts, provided throughout a website or application, create  familiarity and reduce cognitive load. The advantages of familiarity and  reduced cognitive load are that processes are easier to follow and appear to be  less complex. This may benefit users with cognitive accessibility needs in  several ways, including:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>If the user perceives the  activity to be too complex, the user may decide to abandon the activity. Therefore, the user will be excluded from the information and/or the services derived from the  completion of the activity. Familiarity and consistent cues will alleviate this  considerably.</li>
                  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>If an activity relies on  completion  of several tasks, then the likelihood of errors being made during the activity  increases, particularly for users with cognitive accessibility needs, if the  cues provided are inconsistent.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>While providing consistent cues is of benefit to all users, it is of  particular benefit to a wide range of users with differing cognitive accessibility  needs, including users with:</p>
<ul>
                  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>language-related disabilities;</li>
                  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>memory-related disabilities;</li>
                  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>disabilities that affect executive function and decision making; and</li>
                  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>focus-and-attention-related  disabilities.</li>
                </ul>
<p>Providing consistent cues is a cornerstone of good UX design. They not only benefit users  with diverse cognitive accessibility needs, but also benefit any user who is  unfamiliar with the content. As such, the benefits are not restricted to a  relatively small subset of users.<br>

		        <h2>Testability</h2>
		        <p><strong>Test Procedure</strong></p>
<ol>
                  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>Ensure, by inspection, that headings and regions are identified consistently.</li>
                  <li>Change the states of elements, such as tab panels and selected options. Confirm that each cue is consistent with other cues within a set of web pages.</li>
                </ol>
		        <p><strong>Automatic tests can include if:</strong></p>
		        <p>CSS toggles consistently on different states on similar items;</p>
		        <p>CSS is used consistently on headings, roles, personalization, and semantics.</p>
		        <p>&nbsp;</p>

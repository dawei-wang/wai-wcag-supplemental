                <p class="sctxt">@@<strong>3.2.5 Change on Request: </strong>Changes of context, functionality, settings, <em>route</em> and <em>orientation</em>  are initiated only by user request or an <em>easily available mechanism</em> is available to turn off such changes.

Exception: The changes are part of an activity where it is essential (e.g. a game)@@</p>

		        <h2>What Principle and Guideline the SC falls within.</h2>
		        <p>Principle 3, Guideline 3.2 - Predictable<br>
		          Update to 3.2.5</p>
		        <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Any content, settings or functionality which changes unexpectedly, without user initiation can result in significant barriers for users with cognitive disabilities. Unexpected changes in any of these areas can result in loss of focus, anxiety, or confusion in understanding or using a user interface. Examples include but are not limited to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Automatic launching of new windows or pop-ups</li>
                        <li>Submission of forms through mechanisms other than a button that is clearly labeled using simple language to submit the form</li>
                        <li>Rerouting automatically by a GPS</li>
                        <li>Changing the direction of a map in a GPS</li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>For example, a user may not have a sense of direction or know their left and right. Before using a GPS they may study the route so that they know approximately what they are doing and can augment the directions of the GPS with their own context, using the GPS for cues. The GPS automatically reroutes them because  of a small traffic delay. They become completely lost and disorientated and can no longer use the application.</p>
		        <h2>Benefits</h2>
    <p>This Success Criterion give users with cognitive disabilities more control over how Websites and applications behave and display information giving them the opportunity to make choices that enable them to use the content and complete the task.</p>
        <p>Initiating changes only when requested by a user is particularly helpful for:</p>
                     <ul>
                         <li>Focus and attention related disabilities</li>
                         <li>Users with weak orientation</li>
                         <li>Users with low executive function</li>
                         <li>Memory related disabilities</li>
                         <li>Users with anxiety disorders</li>
                    </ul>

		        <h2>Testability</h2>
    <p>For all content </p>
    <p><span class="sctxt">Step 1: Identify any automatic changes in context, functionality, settings, route and orientation</span> (using a similar way to how we identify changes in context now)</p>
    <p>Step 2: Confirm there is an easy way for the user to suppress any changes from step 1</p>
    <p>Step 3: <span class="sctxt">Confirm an easy to use mechanism is available to go to the previous context,  functionality, settings, route and orientation from Step 1. </span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Content specific examples</strong></p>
    <p>For slide shows, audio or video, confirm that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Content does not autoplay or</li>
        <li>A mechanism for stopping or pausing  is present</li>
</ul>
<p>For intermittent content updates such as news feeds or embedded social media updates, confirm that:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A mechanism for pausing an update is present</li>
        <li>A roll back is present</li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
	
		        <h2>Techniques</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li> Providing warning for any of the changes in context  and allowing the user to prevent the change if required. The warning allows sufficient time for the user to process the warning and react.</li>
<li>Providing a "pause" button for sideshows, video and audio</li>
                    <li>Providing  a "request update" and "pause update" button for news feeds or embedded social media updates</li>
                    <li>Setting the autoplay attribute on an embedded YouTube video to "0"</li>
                    <li>Using semantics and personalization to control changes</li>
                    <li>Allowing a user to turn off reroutes</li>
                    <li>Allowing a user to turn off changes in orientation</li>

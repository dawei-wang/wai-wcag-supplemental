                    <p>This topic is directly related to Principle 2 "Operable", as failure to successfully overcome user authentication barriers will mean that users are unable to access and make use of underlying content.</p>
                    <h2><a id="user-content-description" href="https://github.com/w3c/wcag21/wiki/Proposals-for-new-Success-Criteria#description" aria-hidden="true"></a>Description</h2>
                    <p>The intent of this success criterion is to ensure that, if users are able to make use of content they are seeking, they do not encounter a barrier that prevents them from accessing it.</p>
                    <p>Most user interfaces are designed to help users complete tasks. However, traditionally, web security and privacy technologies intentionally introduce barriers to task completion. They require users to perceive more and to do more to complete tasks.</p>
                    <p>Many user authentication methods rely upon trying to differentiate between a human, and software (bots) that try to pose as a human. The most common way of trying to make this distinction is by the setting of tasks that rely upon human abilities, and that are almost impossible for software (bots) to perform. These methods can frequently be quite challenging for people who have a high level of relevant ability. For people who have a lower level of relevant ability, an authentication task often presents an insurmountable barrier.</p>
                    <p>An alternative user authentication method is required for users who are temporarily or permanently unable to use the primary user-authentication method. One important example is where users would be unable to use a primary user authentication method, such as when they do not have a suitable trusted device, or if they are not subscribed to or are unable to access third-party services (often part of user authentication methods), which would meet the criteria for primary user-authentication methods.</p>
                    <p>The six abilities that are referred to in the alternative <span id="docs-internal-guid-9beb1966-66b8-fe9a-5ca5-4897cd3bb8a">success criterion</span> are those that are frequently employed as user authentication methods. The SC asks for the availability of at least one method that does not rely upon any of these abilities being offered.</p>
                    <h2><a id="user-content-benefits" href="https://github.com/w3c/wcag21/wiki/Proposals-for-new-Success-Criteria#benefits" aria-hidden="true"></a>Benefits</h2>
                    <p>Without this <span id="docs-internal-guid-9beb1966-66b8-fe9a-5ca5-4897cd3bb8a2">success criterion</span>, many people  cannot use an application or content at all. See <a rel="nofollow" href="https://rawgit.com/w3c/coga/master/issue-papers/privacy-security.html">Security and Privacy Technologies</a> issue paper for the full description of this issue, and how it stops  people from using web services that are often critical. Many people cannot make doctors appointments, etc., by themselves. This may be partly responsible for the reduced life expectancy of people with learning and cognitive disabilities.</p>
                    <p>With this <span id="docs-internal-guid-9beb1966-66b8-fe9a-5ca5-4897cd3bb8a4">success criterion</span>, people who are able to use a primary user authentication method will be able to successfully complete a user authentication procedure almost irrespective of the level of their cognitive abilities. Those who have to use an alternative method will be able to successfully complete a user authentication even though they have limited levels of the cognitive abilities specified in the <span id="docs-internal-guid-9beb1966-66b8-fe9a-5ca5-4897cd3bb8a5">success criterion</span>.</p>

                    <p><strong>Test option 1</strong>: Check if one of the  user authentication methods offered conforms to sufficient techniques for primary authentication below, and if there is an alternative authentication method that conforms to sufficient techniques for alternative authentication.</p>
                    <p>Or </p>
                    <p><strong>Test option 2:</strong> Inspection of user authentication methods offered by a web service to determine there is one available that does not contain tasks that are dependent on a user's cognitive abilities <span class="sctxt"> to memorize information; recall information from memory; speak; or mentally process presented or recalled information beyond the mental processes that are required to use a simple web page.</span>; and inspection of alternative methods to determine whether they involve the  human abilities specified for alternative methods.</p>
                    <p>Note: Option 1 is simple to check for developers. It is provided as an easy way to quickly test. We should identify all know conformant security mechanism and most developers can simply use one. </p>
                    <p>However some developers may need a different method, or maybe developing their own security. In this unusual case they will need to understand cognitive abilities and what tasks <span class="sctxt">depend on the ability to memorize information; recall information from memory; speak; and mentally process  information. To help them we have the  issue paper and research document that explains these functions in  detail. </span></p>
                    <p>Having these two methods allow most developers to easily conform and developers pioneering new security to conform, although time and effort may be required.</p>
                    <h2><a id="user-content-techniques" href="https://github.com/w3c/wcag21/wiki/Proposals-for-new-Success-Criteria#techniques" aria-hidden="true"></a>Techniques</h2>
                    <p>
                        Using the web authentications specification
                        may enable full compliance
                        for primary and secondary methods. But, we need to confirm this when it gets to CR. A technique may be written to show how to use it in a conforming way.
                    <p>
                        Other methods  of meeting the requirements for primary user authentication would include:
                        <ol>
                            <li> Automatic user authentication based upon the use of a trusted device (to which the user has already logged in with their own identity); </li>
                            <li>biometrics;                                                             </li>
                            <li>being already logged in to  third-party authentication services (e.g., OAuth, Facebook, etc.).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </li>
                        </ol>
                    <p>
                        Methods  of meeting requirements for  alternative user authentication would include:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Clicking a link sent to an email address or a phone number; (<span id="docs-internal-guid-9beb1966-66bf-a155-996e-cc15a6a15149">Note that this is easy to implement and may be useful for minimal security, such as allowing  comments on a blog)</span></li>
                            <li>Logging in by using information present in users' personal documentation, such as the total number of a current account balance, with explanation on how to find this information.                                                            </li>
                        </ol>

            <h2>Working group notes</h2>
            <p>We had a discussion of <span class="sctxt">whether an alternative user authentication</span> method should be included, as banks and others may find it too hard. </p>
            <p>We concluded it was okay because they can provide an alternative, easy to use method, such as a USB key.</p>
            <p>However, we could add an exception for the <span class="sctxt">alternative user authentication</span>, which we will need to define, for highly-sensitive data.</p>

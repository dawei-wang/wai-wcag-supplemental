    <p><strong>harm:</strong> Loss of or damage to a person's right, property, or physical or mental well-being. Where it is unclear if something is a damage we consider a test to be that over 80% of random people asked would consider it to be a damage as defined above. </p>

    <h2>What Principle and Guideline the SC falls within.</h2>
    <p>
        Suggested priciple is 2,<br>
    </p>
    <p>and we suggest changing guideline 2.3  from</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Do not design content in a way that is known to cause seizures.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>to</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Do not design content in a way that is known to harm users.</li>

    <h2>Description and Benefits</h2>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p dir="ltr">Don&rsquo;t store personal information that could be used to harm a user <span id="docs-internal-guid-9beb1966-67be-464c-9583-1f218318556e">without being very careful to minimise any risk to the user</span>.</p>
    <br>
    <p dir="ltr">Examples: storing information, which suggests a user user has Dementia, may make a target for scams; or storing information, which suggests a user has an intellectual disability, may make a target for predators. </p>
    <p dir="ltr">A predatory company could send requests for money, saying &ldquo;you haven&rsquo;t made your donation&rdquo; despite the user having made one. </p>
    <br>
    <p dir="ltr">It is vital that users stay safe.</p>
    <p dir="ltr">Another consideration is that many users have weak executive functioning, and are thus less likely to identify risks correctly.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    The benefit of this SC is to keep users safe while online.

        <li>Step 2. Identify if one of the known techniques are used. </li>
        <li>Step 3. Identify that the risks are available to users in clear language. </li>

		        <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to provide headings for all sections of a Web page. The current Success Criterion is included at Level AAA, however headings can be implemented as invisible by authors or hidden by a user and included when needed using personalization and semantics. The option to implement headings which are not necessarily visually displayed to any or all users, makes the suggested success criterion widely applicable and able to be included at level AA as opposed to AAA. For example, a long letter would often cover different topics, but putting headings into a letter would be strange, so they would only be visible on the user request or from personalization settings. </p><p>The main reason to upgrade the conformance level is to be consistent with user needs that are addressed across the different disabilities.</p>

		        <h2><a id="user-content-benefits" href="https://github.com/w3c/wcag21/wiki/Proposals-for-new-Success-Criteria#benefits" aria-hidden="true"></a>Benefits</h2>
		        <p>Headings provide a roadmap for readers. They provide assistance in knowing what to expect and where to find information. This grouping of information within written content is helpful to guide readers and can be useful for users experiencing difficulty with language and reading comprehension. Readers with difficulty retaining focus can benefit as headings will help the user orientate themselves within the content of a page. User research shows that content created specifically for users with dyslexia tends to have well-structured text with headings, thereby reducing reading of irrelevant text.</p>

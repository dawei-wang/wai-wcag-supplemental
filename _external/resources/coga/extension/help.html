		        <h2><strong>What Principle and Guideline the SC falls within.</strong></h2>

		        <p>Principle 3, Guideline 3.3 - Input Assistance</p>
		        <h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>

		        <p>The use of complex information, long documents and data in a particular  format and the use of non-standard controls in Web forms can present significant barriers  to users with cognitive accessibility needs. The intent of this Success Criterion  is to ensure that navigation, operability and the ability to complete tasks  associated with a website is fully understandable and accessible to people with  cognitive accessibility needs through the provision of context sensitive help, tooltips and explanation of jargon. For example:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>A user with dyscalculia may have  difficulty processing temperature data when presented only in a numeric format.  However if non-numeric alternatives are provided (cold, warm, hot etc.) then  the likelihood that they will have no issue in processing the data is high.</li>
                  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>Promoting clarity when complex information  is presented by providing a summary or keywords will make the information more  accessible to all users, especially users with cognitive accessibility needs.</li>
                  <li>People  who find reading or language difficult can be helped by a chart or graph.</li>
                  <li>People who do not know their left from right will be able to use navigation systems.</li>
</ul>
                <p>The main reason for the upgrade in the conformance level is to ensure that user needs are consistently addressed across the different disabilities. </p>
                <p>Note that graphics should be clear and it should be easy to identify meaning and context.  The ability to "read between the lines"; of a text, graphic, or  lecture may seem obvious to many users without cognitive accessibility needs but it may create barriers for people with autism, who may not be able to readily   discern the intended relevance of graphical data.</p>
                <p>Further use aria-describedby to associate the graphic or sections   of a graphic or chart and the text that describes it can be read by a   screen reader while the right section of the chart is highlighted.</p>

                <h2><strong>Benefits</strong></h2>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>The benefit to users with cognitive accessibility needs is that the  information in the help is presented in a way that it is  understandable  and therefore supports the user in accessing the information or service which would  otherwise be too complex for them to consume. This Success Criterion addresses  two broad classes of issues associated with this type of information:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>If the user perceives the  activity to be too complex the user may decide to abandon the activity and  therefore be excluded from the information and/or services derived from the  completion of the activity.</li>
                  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>If the activity relies on the  comprehension of complex information, long documents, data in a particular  format or non-standard controls then the likelihood of errors being made during  the activity increases, particularly for users with cognitive accessibility  needs.</li>
</ul>
                <p>While providing clarity and accessibility is of benefit to all users it  is of particular benefit to a wide range of users with differing cognitive accessibility  needs including users with:</p>
<ul>
                  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>Language related disabilities</li>
                  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>Memory related disabilities</li>
                  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>Disabilities that effect  executive function and decision making</li>
                  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>Focus and attention related  disabilities</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Providing comprehensive help not only benefits  users with diverse cognitive accessibility needs but also benefits any user who  is unfamiliar with the material and therefore the benefits are not restricted to  a relatively small subset of users.</p>
                <p><br>

                    <p>This success criterion prevents people from:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>tricking users in a way that specifically targets people with cognitive disabilities; <strong>and then </strong></li>
                        <li>claiming they conform to specifications for accessibility and inclusion. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>For example, some commerce sites automatically increment the number of items selected without warning the user. Most users will notice that they have ordered two bicycles, or that the price is double the anticipated price. However, someone with a  disability, such as dementia or severe dyscalculia, may be unable to notice the change. Indeed, many of these scams are  targeting people who have a cognitive disability, the aging, and new-Internet users.</p>
                    <p>Having been subject to these tricks, users lose confidence in their ability to perform tasks online. The cumulative effects of this type of behavior is that many users, who need access to commerce, will be the least likely to be able to  use it.</p>
                    <p>This success criterion prevents people from tricking users in a way that specifically targets people with cognitive disabilities; and claiming they are conforming to specifications for accessibility and inclusion. </p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <div>There are also other ways that people can add mechanisms that confuse the user and cause harm such as:</div>
                    <div>
                      <ul>
                        <li>they accept a misleading option that could do them harm by exposing private information or, </li>
                        <li>downloading software that have harmful effects that were not made clear to the user.</li>
                      </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div> Sites that include these bad practices should not be able to conform to WCAG.<strong> </strong></div>
                    <p>It is worth noting that a COGA task force member has downloaded malicious software during the booking process to a disability event.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <p>The benefit of this success criterion is that users can be safe online, and will be able to participate in the Internet community. </p>
